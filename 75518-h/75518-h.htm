<p>
Beautiful even with the trench and wall of Diocletian's
comparatively recent siege scarring the orchards and
vineyards of Lake Mareotis, splendid even though her broken
canals and aqueducts had never been repaired, and part of her
western quarter still displayed heaps of calcined ruins where
had been temples, palaces and academies, Alexandria lay
shimmering under the African sun.  Between the turquoise of the
Mediterranean on the north and west, the beryl green of the
Delta on the east, and the flaming opal of the Desert south
and again east of the Delta, the Queen city of the dead old
Ptolemies, set about with vineyards, fair orchards and stately
palm-groves stretching in a broad band of shade and fruitfulness
from the Lake across the Desert, and fringing both sides
of the Nilotic canal, well merited the title: "Queen Emerald of
the Jewelled Girdle," bestowed upon her by the librarian who
unloaded upon Posterity a geographical treatise in heroic
verse.
</p>

<p>
The vintage of Egypt was in full swing, the figs and dates
were being harvested.  Swarms of wasps and hornets, armed
with formidable stings, yellow-striped like the dreaded nomads
of the south and eastern frontiers, greedily sucked the sugary
juices of the ripe fruit.  Flocks of fig-birds twittered amongst
the branches, being like the date-pigeons, almost too gorged
to fly.  Half-naked, earth-brown or tawny-skinned native
labourers, hybrids of mingled races, with heads close-shaven
save for a topknot; dwellers in mud-hovels, drudges of the
water-wheel, cut down the heavy grape-clusters with
sickle-shaped copper knives.
</p>

<p>
Ebony, woolly-haired negroes in clean white breech-cloths,
piled up the gathered fruit in tall baskets woven of reeds and
lined with leaves.  Copts with the rich reddish skins, the long
eyes and boldly-curving profiles of Egyptian warriors and
monarchs as represented on the walls of ancient temples of
Libya and the Thebaïd, moved about in leather-girdled blue
linen tunics and hide sandals, keeping account of the laden
panniers, roped upon the backs of diminutive asses, and
carried to the wine-presses as fast as they were filled.  There
would be a glut of the thin sweet drink that was exported in
clay flagons with round bases; a vintage as disesteemed in the
era of the last Queen Cleopatra by the wine-bibbing
Alexandrians, as to-day under the joint sway of the Emperor
Diocletian and his co-regent, the swineherd Maximianus.
</p>

<p>
The negroes sang as they set snares, and the fig-birds
beloved of the epicurean fell by hundreds into the limed
horse-hair traps.  Greek, Egyptian and negro girls, laughing under
garlands of hibiscus, periwinkle and tuberoses, coaxed the fat
morsels out of the black men to carry home for a supper-treat;
while acrobats, comic singers, sellers of cakes, drinks
and sweetmeats, with strolling jugglers and jesters, and Jewish
fortune-tellers of both sexes, assailed the workers and the
merrymakers with importunities, and made harvest in their
own way.
</p>

<p>
Despite the scars left by the siege of Diocletian,&mdash;whose
clemency in stopping the pillage of the city was recalled by
a bronze statue of the tyrant, placed on the summit of a
column in the middle of the Serapium,&mdash;Alexandria was still
not only mistress of her own huge trade in corn, but the port
through which the European trade of India and Arabia passed.
</p>

<p>
The Great Port and its fellow basin of Eunostus were
crowded with shipping both native and foreign, the quays
were choked with merchandise of innumerable kinds, and
thronged with men of all the world's known nations.  The
copper-hued Egyptian, the diamond-eyed, sharp-witted Greek,
the olive-skinned, aquiline-featured Hebrew with his furred
robe, high headdress, long beard and side-curls, jostled the
supple Italian, the lively Gaul, the slow Boeotian, and the
Ethiopian cloaked with leopard-skins, displaying ivory rings
in his dark ears, and on his arms and fingers, and ivory suns
and moons suspended from a thread of sacred knots upon his
naked breast.  Here merchants from the scarce-known Tsin
State, south of Hind, pig-tailed, slant-eyed men in cartwheel
hats of woven grass, embroidered silks and felt-soled shoes&mdash;again
encountered, on this neutral soil of Egypt, their ancient
enemy, the Tartar.  Here also were Hindu Buddhist pilgrims
wearing yellow robes, and carrying begging-bowls and
armpit-crutches, Fire-worshippers in snowy white, and Persian
merchants in long-sleeved caftans and tall lambskin headdresses.
The nomad of the Desert&mdash;his black leather head-veil bound
by thongs about his lean, brown temples, his great striped
mantle of camel's hair cast about his painted nakedness,
bartering spices and frankincense from Arabia Felix, for gold and
silver jewellery and strings of pink and blue pearls from the
eastern shores of the Red Sea to deck his womankind, rubbed
shoulders with the Scythian, thick of tongue, solid of bone
and heavy of shoulder, bow-legged with continual riding, his
shaggy head protected by a cone-shaped cap of hairy horse-hide,
his back cloaked, his feet shod, and his loins clouted with
tanned horse-leather, which also covered his brass-nailed shield
and sheathed his short iron sword.  And among the slaves of
many nations, staggering under great crates and bales between
the quays and the warehouses, were seen huge semi-naked men
with matted yellow hair, and blue or grey eyes; whose white
skins were decorated with animals, birds and flowers traced in
blue pigment, and upon whose limbs were soldered the heavy
bronze anklet and armlet, with rings to accommodate a chain,
often needed by the refractory slave.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"They are Britons," the Alexandrians would say, fanning
themselves and smiling.  "We have mercenaries of the race
in our Tenth Legion, but these are dull fellows, too stupid to
fight.  What can you expect from a country that produces
nothing but tin and oysters?  Strong slaves and comely
enough, but dangerous when goaded.  And in captivity they
never laugh!"
</p>

<p>
A charge which could not be laid to the accusers, for
ground as they were to the earth beneath the iron heel of a
despotic Roman government, the Alexandrians laughed in
season and out.  They made their successive rulers dread to
provoke the onslaughts of their waspish ridicule.  Wit was the
point of the dagger that could find its way through a tyrant's
harness, a venomed jest could make him writhe with much
more safety to the community than the contents of the poison-phial
dropped into the dish before its cover was put on, and
the steward's clay seal affixed.  They were tepid in their
religion, vain, proud, boastful and spiteful, unstable in their
friendships, languid in business, indifferent to reputation,
fickle in friendship, furious in lust, unrelenting in vengeance,
merciless in jealousy, cold in their natural affections, and
faithless in love.  They wrote no histories, but had a cultured taste
in cookery, perfumes, dress, music and dancing; erotic poetry,
and exotic vice; and on the stars of the theatre, of the
Gymnasium and the Hippodrome, they lavished all the enthusiasm
they possessed.  The famous charioteer, the great singer or
dancer, the comic actor whose jokes set the whole city in a
roar; the unconquerable wrestler, or swordsman, or pugilist
who happened to be the idol of the moment, daily walked
surrounded by his admirers on the promontory of Lochias, or
in the public gardens under the palm-groves, attired in the
scarlet robes of the ultra-fashionable, loaded with jewelled
necklaces, carrying in gem-encrusted fingers a golden-handled
fan of flamingo or parrots' feathers, and wearing scented
garlands on his crimped and perfumed hair.  Banquets were given
to famous fighting-cocks, which, perched at the right hand
of the couch of the host, fed upon sesame from golden platters,
and sipped distilled water from precious bowls of white
and purple Murrhine spar.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Amidst the luxury and corruption of this city, whose roaring
floods of traffic rolled between buildings marvellously
diverse in their mingling of Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Semitic
styles of architecture, the clash of creeds was never wanting,
and ancient faiths and newer revelations struggled for
supremacy.  The glorious psalms of David, rising from the
Synagogue, mingled with the shrill rattle of the sistrum, and
the strains of the hymn addressed to Isis, the goddess of the
Throned Moon.  Serapis, lord of the under-world, was yet
worshipped though the Serapium lay in ruins,&mdash;the Persian
Mithra had his following, and the annual festival of Pan was
celebrated in the temple&mdash;wrought in pink African granite to
the semblance of a phallus, that dwarfed every other building
in Alexandria save the Lighthouse of the Pharos, soaring four
hundred feet above its base of Cyclopæan rock.  And a purer
and more radiant light than that of the Pharos burned in
Alexandria, where the Mysteries of the Catholic Church of
CHRIST were celebrated in temples converted from the service
of the deities of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.
</p>

<p>
The four hundred columns of the ruined Serapium overhung
the quadrangle of thick-walled, buttressed stone buildings
where the Christian Patriarch, his clergy, monks, deacons
and aspirants were unpretendingly housed.  Of his followers,
religious and secular, thirty thousand mustered in Alexandria,
whilst the lay helpers, organised in the vast Guild of the
Parabolani, literally "<i>those who expose themselves to danger</i>"
laboured by day and night amongst the miserable, the homeless,
the famine-bitten and the fever-stricken, rotting in the
purlieus, the prisons and the poorest quarters of the city,
sufferers chiefly of Greek and Egyptian nationality, for the
population of the teeming Jewish quarter were as always, charitable
to their own.  Thus Christian schools and orphanages were
set up, supported and instructed; hospitals established, staffed
and maintained; catechumens brought to the priests for
instruction, and the dead buried with all decency by Christian
men who went forth in the coarse habit of sackcloth, with the
cowl that covered the entire face, and only showed the eyes.
</p>

<p>
The persecution of Maximianus, much more severe than that
following the issue of the New Law of Diocletian, had now
exposed the disgraceful practices of these besotted dupes.  For
weeks past the city had buzzed and stung like a veritable
nest of hornets, poked into venomous life by the secret
activities of Arius the Presbyter, the open malevolence of the
Pagans, and the bitter enmity of the Jews.
</p>

<p>
The deceased Prefect of Egypt had been a ruler not
favourably disposed towards the Christians.  By his successor,
Mettius Rufus, the savage Imperial edict was ruthlessly
enforced.
</p>

<p>
Christian prelates, priests, monks, nuns, deaconesses and
catechumens had been arrested, imprisoned, executed or
tortured by the soldiers of the Third Egyptian Legion,&mdash;far
more accustomed of late years to quelling street riots and
displaying their glittering harness and handsome persons at
military and civic spectacles, than to making wholesale battues
of unarmed and unresisting men and women.  Detachments
of cohorts stationed throughout Libya were sent to raid the
hermitages, monasteries and nunneries on the Nile banks and
upon the borders of the Desert.  At Mount Nitria and in
Scete as at Scyras, they had made many captures; though at
Tabenna in the Thebaïd, where the venerable Abbot Pachomius
had gathered about him thirteen hundred followers, so
stout a resistance was made by the monks, with staves, great
stones and boiling pitch and water, that three maniples of
soldiers of the Fourth Lusitanian Legion, compelled to
abandon the siege, returned, to exhibit their wounds and burns to
Perocles, the military prefect of Apollinopolis, entreating him
with tears of rage, to send them back in sufficient force to wipe
out the shame of defeat sustained at such abominable hands.
</p>

<p>
All classes of society were sifted by a process which netted
a number of suspects.  Amongst the labourers in the vineyards,
the toilers on the quays, in the thronged marts of commerce,
as amongst the crowds at the baths, the lecture-halls, the
theatre, the Gymnasium and the Hippodrome, moved close-lipped,
silent men in plain clothing, with sharp, greedy ears
and keen, observant eyes.  These were called The Listeners,
and carried in the sleeve short rods tipped with a gilt Roman
Eagle, and the maw of that fierce and bloody bird was never
satisfied.  Apostasy was rewarded by temporary immunity.
Obduracy merited what it received, in banishment to the mines,
forfeiture of property, exile, slavery or torture to the death.
Many persons accused, even before coming into Court,
renounced the Faith and reverted to Paganism, or after
imprisonment and some degree of torture, sacrificed, and were set
free.  Yet others escaped into Syria, where the law, though
the same in effect, was less unmercifully carried out.  But
others who held public posts were fettered by their official
duties, and even had it been possible, would have scorned to
seek safety in flight.

<p>
In the case of certain men and women, wealthy or poor,
highly placed or humble, the Voice that speaks to the destined
martyr cried and would not be shut out.  Thus the comic
singer Metras whose impromptu verses were wont to set
the whole city in a roar, the famous retiarius Apollos,
conqueror in twenty battles against armed gladiators, and the
aged historian Sinias, confessed themselves Christians and
were dragged away to death.
</p>

<p>
Hesychius, the editor of the Septuagint, heard the call as
he worked amongst the rolls of papyri in his study, and like
others, he sustained the ordeal and claimed the crown and
palm.  And it came to the noble Roman, Philoremus Florens
Fabius, Prætor of the taxes of Egypt, and a personal friend
of the Prefect: Fabius, who sat daily in public as a judge in
Alexandria, purple-robed, attended by lictors, <i>librarii</i> and
<i>commentarienses</i>; surrounded by a guard of the Third Egyptian
Legion; deciding all causes relative to the taxes, and
administering the law....
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0102"></a></p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
The official and private dwelling of Philoremus Fabius was
a handsome building of Roman architecture, situated in the
fashionable Street of the Winds, south of the quadruple
marble gateway that marked the junction of the city's four
great thoroughfares; running east from the Canopic Gate,
west from the Gate of the Necropolis; and respectively north
and south from the Gates of the Sun, and of the Moon.
</p>

<p>
Before the gnomon of the sun-dial on the column of the
Forum indicated the hour previous to noon-day, a traveller
mounted on a large white mule, and followed by an attendant
riding a dun-coloured animal, and leading another laden with
baggage, reined out of the double stream of horse-drawn,
carved, painted and gilded chariots conveying fashionables
of both sexes; litters and chairs borne by slaves; burdened
camels guided by negroes or Saracens; curled and scarlet-robed
dandies walking with boon companions, fiery barbs
bestridden by Roman officers; and little asses carrying Copts or
Jews,&mdash;that ceaselessly traversed the Street of the Winds.
</p>

<p>
As the small hoofs of the mules slipped on the uneven flagstones
before the mansion of the Prætor of Taxes, the man
on the white mule uttered an involuntary cry.  His eyes had
fallen on a square plaque of bronze fixed on the wall beside
the courtyard entrance, displaying the device of the Roman
Imperial Eagle with the thunderbolt, above the name and
official titles of the master of the house.  A narrow strip of
parchment some twelve inches long, secured by an official seal
at either extremity, was pasted across the name of Philoremus
Fabius and inscribed with the words;
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "<i>SUSPENDED FROM OFFICE UNDER<br>
  SUSPICION OF CHRISTIANITY.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The seal was that of Lollius Maxius, governor of
Alexandria, a personal friend of the official thus disgraced.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the rider of the white mule remained with
open mouth and staring eyeballs, livid as a mask of yellow
wax under the hood of his black riding-cloak of felted camel's
hair.  His strongly marked visage with its arched black
eyebrows, large mobile black eyes and boldly curving profile,
showed, like the face of his attendant, the characteristics of
the Jewish race.  Large rings set with beryls were in his ears,
and massive bracelets of gold clasped his swarthy arms above
the elbow; while his carefully curled hair was protected from
the dust of travel by a square-shaped bag of fine black leather,
embroidered with seed-pearls.  He endeavoured to control his
voice, but it shook as he said to his companion, in Hebrew:
</p>

<p>
"Now in the name of the God of our forefathers! ... Tell
me, O Ezra, son of Ephraim! do I see the thing that is, or
that which is not?  It may be that the fever I suffered at Joppa
still troubles my brain and heats my blood!"
</p>

<p>
His eyes had entreaty in them as he appealed to the other,
and his pallor grew more livid as he heard the reply:
</p>

<p>
"Health is yours, O Hazaël, son of Hazaël, but misfortune
has befallen our master.  He is suspected of Christianity, and
suspended from office under the Governor's seal."
</p>

<p>
"Some enemy hath done this thing!" said Hazaël fiercely.
"Be the Mighty One blessed that I have speedily returned
home!  Hold the mule's rein while I knock upon these doors
that were never shut till now in the face of Hazaël."
</p>

<p>
And hastily dismounting while Ezra held the stirrup, Hazaël
plucked a metal-shod staff from a bucket-holster slung behind
his saddle, and beat loudly upon the bronze doors fixed in a
frame of square beams of yellow Numidian marble, until a
metal bolt groaned in its grooves of stone, a leaf of the door
moved inwards, and the black face of an Ethiopian slave
peered out between the valves.  White eyeballs and dazzling
teeth flashed in the ebony visage:
</p>

<p>
"By Isis the Dog Star!" he jabbered in his bastard Græco
Egyptian, "The Jew Hazaël has come back to us again!"
</p>

<p>
"Son of abomination, make way!" said Hazaël, violently
thrusting back the door upon the astonished Ethiopian, and
striding into the vestibule, over a square of mosaic let into
the marble pavement, representing a black dog spotted with
white, secured by a chain attached to a red leather collar, and
displaying a formidable mouthful of teeth as in the act to
bite.  A second Ethiopian, liveried like the first in a green
tunic with a broad girdle covered with plates of silver, stooped
low in humble salutation, touching with his yellowish
fingertips the booted feet of the Jew.
</p>

<p>
The walls of the vestibule, from either side of which
opened a waiting-room for clients, were painted light red,
divided into panels by a vertical ornament, a black caduceus
wreathed with a vine.  Along the base of either wall ran a
broad bench of black walnut, on which sprawled or sat four
unhelmed and ungirt Legionaries, of whom two slept on the
shady side&mdash;for broad sunshine poured through the overhead
opening&mdash;two were playing dice, with a flagon of Mareotic
wine standing between them, from which one or the other
drank a draught at every lucky throw&mdash;while two more stood
on guard, rigid and immovable as statues of men in glittering
cuirasses, on either side of the curtained portal leading to the
<i>atrium</i>, a hall of some forty feet in length, paved with <i>tesseræ</i>
of black and yellow marble, and centred with a square pool, in
the midst of which a little fountain played.  Yet two other
Roman soldiers, with shield on arm and grounded javelins,
kept ward outside the curtained entrance of the large apartment
at the farther end.  When the first two Legionaries with
their drawn swords, made as though to prevent his passage,
Hazaël said with cutting irony:
</p>

<p>
"The Prætor Philoremus Fabius labours beneath the displeasure
of the Prefect, Mettius Rufus.  Thus he is at present
a prisoner beneath his own roof.  But the Chief Secretary
of the Prætor of the Taxes is also an official of the Roman
Empire.  Until I am deprived of this token of mine office"&mdash;he
lifted the end of a heavy golden chain that peeped beneath
his sheathed beard and lay upon his bosom&mdash;"I hold and use
it.  Lower your swords!"
</p>

<p>
And he thrust beneath the curtain of many-coloured Egyptian
linen, and moved on to the doorway of the room that lay
beyond.  The guards at this point had overheard; and when
Hazaël moved aside the end of his beard and pointed to the
broad gold chain of office ending in his hairy bosom, they
struck the butts of their javelins twice upon the pavement in
salutation, and without a spoken word suffered him to pass.
</p>

<p>
And so the Jew stepped in, moving noiselessly as some
creature of prey in his high black felt knee-boots soled with
elephant's leather, and heeled with sections of the nails of the
brute, powdered like his skin and garments with the vitreous
dust of the Desert and stained with the sweat of the beasts
that had carried him.
</p>

<p>
You saw him as he dropped his great cowled cloak, just
within the threshold, to be a man not yet thirty; salient, strong
and full of energy, with brawny limbs revealed by the short-sleeved
tawny robe hitched mid-leg high by the girdle of
hippopotamus-calf hide, that sustained, as well as a wallet and
water-gourd, a pair of long sharp daggers and a formidable
double-edged sword.  From beneath the high, square,
fur-trimmed cap that the cowl of the mantle had hidden, a bushy
growth of night-black curls, soiled with travel and like the
fringes of his tawny robe, tangled with thorns and prickly
burrs, fell about his shoulders.  He breathed quickly, as
though he had been running; and in the stern, bold, swarthy
face, and the intent wide gaze of the burning black eyes
shadowed under beetling eyebrows, there was sorrow beyond mere
words, and devotion too deep, and pure, and selfless to be
passionate, as Hazaël after many months stood in the presence
of his patron and friend.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The room, or rather hall, had been originally meant for a
triclinium, but by reason of its imposing size and height, and
the suitable elevation of the mosaic floor at its upper end, the
Prætor of the Taxes had set apart the lengthy side-wing and
the upper apartments for his private occupation, and
transacted here such daily business as did not necessitate his
appearance at the Forum.  A frieze of lofty height depicted in
brilliant hues on a white ground, the combats of the Greeks
and Amazons; upon the raised platform at the upper end
stood an ivory arm-chair, and a table of ebony inlaid with
silver.  Small statues of the twelve divinities of Rome,
wrought in bronze, ivory or precious metal, adorned the top
ledges of two ebony bookcases, set against the walls on the
right and left hand, and filled with scrolls that were volumes
of reference, and treatises upon Roman Law and Finance.
</p>

<p>
In the ivory chair sat a man of forty, in a white tunic
bordered with a wide stripe of purple, plunged deep in the
perusal of a small scroll of papyrus thickly inscribed in the
clear rounded characters of Aramaic Greek.  An oblong opening
in the wall behind him, running from wall to wall of the
court-room, gave a view, across an open loggia (where more
Roman guards were posted), of the lawns, alleys and fountains
of a well-kept garden-enclosure; so that the advantage
of light from behind was for the Receiver General of Taxes
hearing cases at his table, with the equally desirable boon of
fresh air.
</p>

<p>
No clients thronged to the tribune to-day, vacant were the
desks and chairs of his recorders and notaries; the scratch of
the ink-filled reed upon the papyrus, the smell of wax tablets
virgin of the stylus, the whispering of the clerks and
accountants no longer came from the adjoining room....
</p>

<p>
How pleasantly quiet it was.  The reader slightly shifted
his feet, shod with <i>cothurni</i> of scarlet leather, ornamented
with golden crescents at the instep, upon the dappled leopard-skins
that spread beneath his chair.  The skins covered a
skilfully-concealed trap-door leading down into a strong vault
underneath the tribune, where were stored vast sums in gold
belonging to the State.
</p>

<p>
To the man reading and thinking in the ivory chair, and as
yet unconscious of the witness on the threshold, the room held
no other living creatures save himself and a late butterfly,
with peacock wings of gorgeous beauty, that had fluttered in
at the window, perhaps attracted by the garlands of wonderfully
painted roses forming part of the decorations below the
cornice of the wall.  A moment the insect wavered to and fro
beneath the cornice; mounted&mdash;sought to settle&mdash;realised the
deceit, and would have flown back into the garden, to feast
upon the nectar of Truth and Reality&mdash;had not a hawking
swallow intervened.
</p>

<p>
There had been no swallows yesterday.  To-day, the blue
sky above the palms and figs and oleanders, the vine-wreathed
sycamores and acacias of the gardens, was alive with the black
and white specks of vitality, darting and wheeling, hovering
and poising as though sporting with their own swift shadows;
hunting their prey of flies, gnats and winged beetles with shrill
squeaks of bird-delight&mdash;while under the tiled coping of a
walled court with a westward aspect, nests were being built
in the selfsame spots, from whence they had been dislodged
by the gardener's pole earlier in the year.
</p>

<p>
The swallow's swoop and dart, more rapid than the eye
might follow, captured the insect of the jewelled wings.  But
the man moved; and the startled bird darted upwards towards
a brilliant square of blue sky framed in a gilded trellis covered
with those deceptive roses, and no less false and treacherous
a painted lure than they...
</p>

<p>
The infinitesimal tragedy was over in a moment.  The
arrow-like flight cleaved no waves of blue æther, but was
arrested by a surface as hard as adamant.  The bird dropped
close to the foot of Philoremus.  He reached down and took
it up.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0103"></a></p>

III
</h3>

<p>
It was quite dead, a tiny corpse, a mere pinch of black and
white feathers; with its prey&mdash;still feebly moving legs and
<i>antennae</i>&mdash;yet held crosswise in the thorn-small, jet-black beak.
What lesson would He Whose Divine teaching the Aramaic
scroll of the Gospel of Matthew, the Evangelist, set forth,&mdash;have
drawn from the desire of the insect for the flowers of
delusion, the delirious rush of its swift-winged captor for
illimitable space and aerial freedom&mdash;arrested by that killing
crash against a tinted stone?
</p>

<p>
Poor tiny feathered migrant from&mdash;what wild northern
homeland?  That of the Alamanni, who built and garrisoned
forts of mud and tree-boles on their Rhine frontiers; fierce
red-haired giants, savage mercenaries of Rome, like the Gauls
with their pointed brazen helmets and painted tunics, covered
with cuirasses of leather strengthened with plates of iron,
adorned with armlets, collars and bracelets of heavy virgin
gold, and perched rather than seated on their high wooden
saddles, girthed back on the hindquarters of great horses with
cropped ears....  Or perhaps the bird came from the freezing
steppes of Scythia, peopled by shaggy savages with flat noses,
slant eyes, and hairy legs bowed from continually riding their
shaggy little beasts.  Or from Britain, a province of which
country Philoremus had ruled as a pro-consul under Carausius,
who, with piratical intentions of his own, had been sent by
Maximianus, co-Emperor with Diocletian, to suppress the
Saxon pirates and the yellow-haired rovers from Scandinavia.
</p>

<p>
The swallow, though fully fledged, was young.  This must
have been its first day in Egypt.  How strange, to have crossed
continents and seas for such an end! thought the Roman
Prætor, and then his glance reverting to the scroll, found there
a saying of the Master:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing, and not one
of them shall fall to the ground without your Father?</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
What bearing had the words with reference to the dead
swallow stiffening on his warm, living palm?  What Divine
purpose could be served by such a waste of effort?  What
wrong had the innocent creature done in hunting its insect
food?  He read on:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.<br>
  Fear not therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.<br>
  Whosoever, therefore, shall confess Me before men,<br>
  I will also confess him before my Father Who is in Heaven.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Perhaps the dead swallow had crossed the sea to bring this
message to the disgraced public servant.  With the thought
a reviving warmth crept about his chilly heart.  He looked
downwards, slightly smiling, from his tribune to a bronze
tripod altar placed upon a square of mosaic in the body of
the hall.  On either side of the altar a Roman sword and
spear were planted upright.  Upon the tripod stood a silver-gilt
chafing-dish containing several sticks of smouldering charcoal.
The dish rested upon a pan of pierced pottery, and near
it were three small vessels respectively containing corn, wine
and incense; also a bowl of lustral water in which was
immersed a leafy olive-twig.  A Latin inscription beneath the
upper ledge of the tripod might thus be translated:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "O HOLY SABUS DIUS FIDIUS SEMIPATER, BE PROPITIOUS!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was the altar on which oaths were taken; solemnly
reconsecrated to the Sabine deity on each recurring fifth of June.
Perhaps if the thoughts behind the broad brow and the blue
eyes of the ex-Prætor had been rendered into speech, they
would have run thus:
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday at this hour I was wealthy, powerful and
dreaded: To-day I am an outlaw without rights or possessions,
waiting the summons to appear before the judges, who
are as likely to condemn me to death by torture, as to send me
to the mines or accord me banishment.  And why has this
happened?  Answer, Ego of Philoremus!  Because something
within me revolts from even the semblance of worship offered
to the deities of Rome.  Revengeful, lustful, treacherous as
Man; subject like him to base passions and earthly frailties;
stained with unnatural crimes and vices, I know them to be
demons; I will no more of them!"
</p>

<p>
"The Pythagorean teachings, the sugared theories of the
Platonists, the philosophy of the Stoics, I have in turn swallowed
and rejected in the reversed condition, as the owl deals
with infant moles and mice!  Vainly I have sought refuge in
the Eleusinian Mysteries.  If there were but one snake in the
sacred basket of the priestess, what a nest of writhing cobras
did I not find behind the Veil!  Isis lured, and I sought her;
after long weeks of trials and austerities I was conducted to
the sanctuary.  Initiate, O Mother and Queen of Harlots!&mdash;only
to be again disillusioned!  The religious cults of Syria
and Asia Minor, the philosophical speculations of the
Gymnosophists of Hind beckoned, and I followed, only to be again
betrayed!  Yet could I not have concealed my doubts and
disgusts, made my convictions march with my interests?  This
Voice, speaking within my bosom, says emphatically No!
Some change has taken place in me, some growth has germinated
unnoticed, even as the fields of the Delta rush into life
and verdure, when the garment of water is withdrawn from
the land by the subsidence of the Nile.  This is my right hand
with the callosity upon the third joint of the third finger&mdash;that
reminds me of the signet that is missing from it&mdash;the thick
gold ring&mdash;set with a black onyx carved in intaglio with the
head of the club-bearing Hercules,&mdash;that was a wedding gift
from my wife.  But the Me within me is changed&mdash;since
yesterday&mdash;as though I had been touched by the living Hand
that over three hundred years ago gave sight to the blind,
cleansed the leper, and raised up the dead."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
A deep voice broke upon the muttered soliloquy.  It said
in shaken accents:
</p>

<p>
"O my master!&mdash;" and broke off.  For the light of joy that
shone in the clear blue eyes that turned to him was almost
too much for Hazaël's sick heart to bear.  He crossed the hall
in three long strides, bent his knee at the foot of the tribune,
mounted its steps, and kissed with his bearded lips the hand
that had worn the black onyx intaglio, even as its owner
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Hazaël!  The man I most wanted.  Welcome back, good
friend, to this house that was my home!"
</p>

<p>
"Now may the Holy One be blessed and praised Who has
led me back to Alexandria in time," responded Hazaël, "to
serve my most gracious lord!  Well has the Prophet said there
is no man so virtuous that he shall escape calumny.  Even
Philoremus, I knew had enemies.  But that does not explain&mdash;"
he gulped,&mdash;"the suspension from office, the soldiers placed on
guard over their own commander&mdash;or read the accursed riddle
of those seals upon the door!"
</p>

<p>
"The answer is very simple, my excellent Hazaël," returned
Philoremus with a quizzical smile.  He rolled up and thrust
the sacred scroll in the breast of his purple-bordered tunic,
and motioned the Jew to seat himself on a stool beside his
chair.  "If suspension from office be public dishonour, at least
it means a private leisure seldom enjoyed.  Sit and let us
talk, nobody will disturb us!  I go before the Prefect of
Alexandria to answer to mine accuser&mdash;but not before to-morrow
at the sixth hour."
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;in the name of the Holiest I conjure you to enlighten
me!  What is this accusation?" burst forth Hazaël.  "Who is
the accuser whose testimony hath such credit as to blacken
so great a personage as yourself in the eyes of men?"
</p>

<p>
And as the hoarsely-spoken words escaped the Jew's mouth,
that was parched with anguish even more than by the acrid
dust of the deserts which he had traversed, Philoremus
answered:
</p>

<p>
"It is said that I am a Christian and I may not deny it.
For the man who hath accused me is none other than
Myself!"
</p>

<p>
"Woe, woe!" cried the anguish-stricken Hebrew, tearing
his beard and striving to rend the tough material of his
garment, while great tears brimmed his under-eyelids and made
furrows in his dusty face.  He checked the violence of his
grief, on seeing a slight shade of disgust pass over the delicate
patrician features of the Roman, and smeared his tears roughly
away with the back of a hairy hand.  "Pardon!" he gasped.
"Forgive me! ... Pray, tell me more!"
</p>

<p>
"First drink some of this wine!" said his master, filling a
crystal goblet from a golden-lidded crystal flagon that stood
upon the table conveniently at hand.  "A Prætor suspended is
as good as hanged&mdash;in the estimation of his slaves and
freed-men," went on Philoremus whimsically, as the Jew gulped
down the draught of which he stood in sore need: "and I make
no doubt that my rascals have been robbing me&mdash;from the
noon-hour of yesterday&mdash;when I received the mandate of
Lollius Maxius, until this moment of thy return.  Therefore
art thou thrice welcome.  For since the seals were placed, and
my own guards set over me, I have brooded over the trapdoor
of this vault that contains the half-year's tax-money of
Egypt&mdash;like a hen sitting upon an addled egg."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all through the night," he added, whimsically smiling
at the indignant astonishment of Hazaël, "until this moment.
Nor would the fellows bring me a meal&mdash;doubtless they have
been too busy plundering me to feed me.  A lump of cheese,
a barley-cake and this flagon of Mareotic, I obtained through
one of my Legionaries, who coaxed it out of the cook!"  He
added, as the breast of Hazaël heaved, and a hoarse sound like
a sob escaped him: "Now you are come to take charge of the
Egyptian tax-money, O excellent Hazaël! a weight is off my
mind.  By Hercules and the Twelve, I find it a relief!  Come,
be not so cast down!"
</p>

<p>
The Jew choked out with difficulty:
</p>

<p>
"To find you accused&mdash;proscribed&mdash;perhaps ruined&mdash;suffocates
me with indignation!"
</p>

<p>
"The Gymnosophists," said the ex-Prætor, "who dwelt
upon a mountain in Ethiopia nearly two thousand years ago,
and are said to dwell there still, would have asked you why
you are disturbed at this intelligence?  'Your patron,' they
would say, 'who enjoyed the semblance of Happiness for many
years, is now to undergo the appearance of Misfortune.'  Happiness
and Misfortune being equally Illusions, why on earth
are you mopping your eyes?"
</p>

<p>
He drew a perfumed handkerchief of fine Egyptian byssus
from a gold-embroidered wallet of gazelle-leather that hung
at his girdle, and said with a smile as he tossed it to Hazaël:
"Waste no more time in tears for one who sees no cause.  We
may thank the banquet the Prefect gives to-night for this
opportunity for conversation.  May he bring as fierce an appetite
to his tunny pickled with oysters, his stuffed and roasted
sucking-pig and larded quails and ortolans as I brought to bear
on my barley-cake and goat's cheese.  Come, my good fellow,
own the truth!  Did you never yet suspect me of coquetting
with Christianity?  Think! ... Not even when I have gone
secretly forth in a sackcloth gown and cowled mask,&mdash;plague
or fever having broken out in the purlieus of the city&mdash;or
in a time of scarcity, when famine pinched the poor?"
</p>

<p>
The Jew shook his shaggy head.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever I saw was seen and forgotten, not being intended
for these eyes.  What presumption had it not been, had I
ventured to question the movements of my patron; who might,
the noble lady his wife being long dead, have entered without
grievous sin into some union of the temporary kind.  Besides,
you forget, O most excellent! that day now fifteen years
past, when a certain Roman officer of high rank, disguised as
a Frankish traveller, sought adventure in the Jewish quarter
of Alexandria."
</p>

<p>
"I have not forgotten!" Philoremus chuckled.  "We had
received intimation the previous year that the Jews of
Alexandria were prospering exceedingly.  Marriages at the
synagogues constantly took place.  Births&mdash;yours is a prolific
race!&mdash;inevitably followed each union.  Immigrations from Ethiopia
and the towns of the Upper Nile continually swelled the
population....  Trade flourished.  Money-bags grew fat,&mdash;and the
coins, being put to usury, bred like maggots.  Yet no Jew
was other than poor&mdash;when it came to paying the tax."
</p>

<p>
"Most excellent, I have observed it!" acquiesced Hazaël
gravely, wondering that his patron could so forget the present
peril in these memories of the past:
</p>

<p>
"Therefore, O Hazaël!  I came disguised into Jewry with
the laudable desire to find out for myself the condition of the
miserable and oppressed race.  It was a Feast Day, and the
narrow and winding streets were foul, and stank exceedingly.
But wreaths of anemones and violets ornamented the
windows, while fat and soot from myriads of twinkling lamps,
shed dubious blessings on the heads of the passers-by.  Within
each house were displayed rich curtains and costly carpets
from the looms of Persia and Babylon.  The goodwives spread
their tables with finest Egyptian linen cloths, and dishes and
cups of silver&mdash;indeed&mdash;I will not take oath that some were not
of gold!  Rich jewels twinkled in their ears, and decked their
wigs and bosoms, and maidens of Israel were among them,
gazelle-eyed, ivory-skinned, beautiful as the virgin daughter
of Demeter....  Frown not, Hazaël, for even when my blood
was young I knew how to respect the virtue of the women
of Israel!  Later, when I turned about to retrace my steps, I
saw an exceedingly unwashed urchin peering in with longing
eyes at a window I had quitted a moment previously.  No
Jewish maid was the object of the young Hazaël's admiration.
On the meagrely-spread table were a dish of lentils dressed in
oil and a common crockery wine-jug; some bread cakes, and
a large flank of tunny in a red pottery dish, swimming in
vinegar."
</p>

<p>
A spark of amusement kindled in the gloomy eyes of Hazaël.
The Roman went on:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps that Jewish urchin might have reached twelve
years.  He was small for his age, filthy exceedingly, and
meagre.  And he hugged his lean stomach, droning a kind
of song with the burden: '<i>I wish!&mdash;I wish!</i>' ... 'And
what dost thou wish?' I asked, coming up unseen behind
him...."
</p>

<p>
The stern lips under Hazaël's matted beard were parted
now in laughter.  He said with a flash of strong white teeth
showing in his dark face:
</p>

<p>
"And I answered: 'I wish it were Sabbath all the week
long!&mdash;or that I had a stomach like a camel's!'  And you asked
'Why?' and I answered, 'Because on Feasts and Sabbaths I
may eat my fill at the tables of the Chosen, while on other
days I fight with dogs upon the quays for the scraps thrown
us by sailors and foreigners.  Thus I am empty six days in
a week of days, and full to bursting on the Seventh!'  Then
you, my lord, said to me,&mdash;I can hear your voice this
moment, 'Come with me, Hazaël, small descendant of Abraham,
and thou shalt eat thy fill of lawful food, every day!'  And
so your greatness took me thence, and placed me in the
household of a Jew who served as scribe to you,&mdash;and stooped to
ask my common, sordid story.  And I told thee how, having
reached my twelfth year&mdash;my good father being a Rab, an
interpreter of the sacred books and a pleader before the Courts
of my people in the town of Acanthon upon the Lower Nile,&mdash;was
brought home dead, having been struck upon the forehead
by a beam of cedar borne upon the back of a camel
led by a Copt....  And that my mother, being a poor widow,
had married a cousin of my father.  And&mdash;that I had found
truth in the saying that the breath of a stepfather chills the
broth.  <i>My</i> broth was not only cold, but salted overmuch
with the tears of many beatings.  Wherefore I ran away from
the village where we dwelt; and begged my way to Alexandria.
That was in the third month <i>Sivan</i>, and it was well into the
seventh month, even <i>Tishri</i>, before I found," he gulped, "a
friend!"
</p>

<p>
"And I," said the ex-Prætor, "the most faithful and discreet
of servants, if a little too peppery of temper at times
for the comfort of my freedmen and slaves.  You developed
with years a genius for the calling of the scribe, akin to that
of Cæsar for the command of armies.  The most disorderly
rabble of ciphers that ever disgraced the pages of a ledger
were transformed beneath the hand of Hazaël into legions
worthy of Rome!  The advancement for which you thank me
came as the reward of your own labours.  My disgrace cannot
blight you,&mdash;my fall cannot bring you toppling.  All
Alexandria knows my Chief Secretary to be an orthodox Jew and
devout Christian-hater!  In how many of the old street-riots
between the Chosen and the monks of Alexandria,&mdash;hast thou
not played the warrior to the tune of cracked crowns and
broken shin-bones, with that great staff of thine?"
</p>

<p>
"It is true!"  A rush of scarlet invaded the Jew's bearded
face, dyeing his forehead and injecting the whites of his eyes.
He dropped his head upon his breast and stammered:
</p>

<p>
"It is verily true!  Ever since my father&mdash;on whom be
Peace!&mdash;taught me to stammer Shema I have abominated the
Christians.  Since his death, and mine oath, I have rejoiced
with the rest of the Chosen at the revival of persecution, little
dreaming that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off, convulsed by a shudder that shook him from
head to foot.  Then he nerved himself, with an effort that
brought sweat-drops starting upon his cheeks, and temples and
forehead, for a final appeal.  "O my loved patron!" he
entreated, "hear me!  Break the abominable spell that has&mdash;I
know not how&mdash;constrained you to embrace a religion only
fitted for unlearned fishermen, common criminals, slaves or
unfortunate persons, publicans and sinners&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A Prætor of Taxes is a publican, I imagine!..." the
Roman official suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Even," returned Hazaël, "as Leviathan among the lizards,
and the Lantern of the Pharos beside a farthing candle or a
glow-worm's light.  Shall one so illustrious as yourself bow
down to the deity that came out of&mdash;Galilee?  The son of
Joseph the carpenter, speaking Aramæan,&mdash;who called
himself, in the madness of delusion or the blasphemy of
possession&mdash;the Son of the Most Holy One, the Lord Who is God!
Who preached the sordid creed of poverty, humility and love;
love not only to kindred and friends, but to enemies, betrayers,
traducers, murderers!  Who was abandoned in disgust by
those who had followed him, and died a shameful death upon
the cross!"
</p>

<p>
Said the Roman, looking out across the loggia at the blue
sky and the darting swallows:
</p>

<p>
"When the white-robed flamens of Jupiter Capitolinus,
standing upon the steps of the portico of the temple, bid the
Romans come and celebrate the mysteries of their god, they
cry, 'All ye that are pure of heart and clean of hands, come
to the sacrifice!'  Yet Jupiter is neither a pure nor a
particularly clean god.  And when the white-robed priestesses of
Ceres bear the round basket through the streets of Alexandria,
do they not scream like so many peahens?  'Sinners, away,
or keep eyes on the ground!  Only the Worthy may dare to
approach us!'  Yet those who participate in the Eleusinian
mysteries do not return worthier than they went!"
</p>

<p>
He poured out a little wine, drank, and said as he set down
the emptied goblet:
</p>

<p>
"When that young wolf in the Christian fold, the evil presbyter
Arius, gave me the password and the sign, that disguised
in the sackcloth robe and masked cowl of the Parabolani, I
might mingle with them in the meetings of their sodalities
and penetrate even to the house of the Christian Patriarch&mdash;the
wretch little knew what a burning curiosity was veiled by
my expressed desire for his rascally aid.  For the Master
to Whom the glory of the world was a transitory spectacle&mdash;the
Teacher Who revealed Himself to the poor and the humble,
and opened His Heart as a Gate of Hope to the sinful
and despised&mdash;discovers in His teaching such absolute
unworldliness as to make it starry clear that He came from
beyond the stars...."
</p>

<p>
The ex-Prætor was silent, but his heart added:
</p>

<p>
"O Divine Man, if only I had known Thee!  O Son of God!
Who could take upon Thee the burden of our earthliness!&mdash;but
to have heard Thy Voice! but to have seen Thy Face!
Perhaps an hour may come&mdash;not too far distant&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And so wonderful a radiance shone upon the brow and in
the eyes of the speaker, despite the ravages of sleeplessness
and anxiety, that Hazaël was stricken dumb.

IV
</h3>

<p>
Suddenly the Jew winced as though stung, exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"How could I have forgotten?  Your son, Florens?"
</p>

<p>
"Florens is well," said the Roman, "and in safety.  Not
here," he answered to Hazaël's look, "but at your own house,
in the care of your excellent wife.  To whom else should I
entrust my most valued possession?  Florens is not yet a
Christian, but I would have him one.  This, should I die, is
my last command to you.  Let me hear you say that I shall
be obeyed!"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël wrung his hands and cried in anguish:
</p>

<p>
"O, my master! as God lives I swear that I will obey you
faithfully!  Were the boy to be dedicated to the Evil One, it
should be done though I were damned for it!"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, my friend!" said the father, with moisture showing
in his bright blue eyes.  Silently a hand-grip was
exchanged between the ex-Prætor and his Chief Secretary.  Then
the former resumed:
</p>

<p>
"Further attend.  I shall pass from the tribunal of the
Prefect to the Hall of the Judges.  Should the decision of the
Court be that I suffer the extreme penalty, take Florens
secretly to the Monastery of Tabenna, in the Upper Thebaïd.
Some time will pass before the Prefect of the Stationaries
of Apollinopolis sends another force to attack that wasp's nest!
You have heard how sturdy a defence they maintained during
the recent siege!  The tribune in command of three maniples
was compelled to withdraw his soldiers.  Though at the
Monastery of Mount Nitria, and that of Scete, and at Scyras, as
at Aphroditopolis, raids were effected without opposition.
Melittus, Abbot of Scete, was brought to the tribunal three
days ago.  He was condemned to be beaten to death with
rods.  Three of the five monks who were in bonds with
Melittus went to the torture.  Two novices they sent to the
mines, in consideration of their youth.  I myself was in the
Hall of the Question, sitting on the high seat with the judges
commissioned by the Prefect of Egypt.  And as Melittus and
his monks were brought forward to be sentenced, each one
looked up to the right of the Catasta* with a brightened face,
and smiled.  For He was there!"
</p>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Hazaël started, so full of awe was the ending of the sentence.
</p>

<p>
"Do you&mdash;you do not mean that you beheld in a vision
Jesus of Nazareth, the Crucified?"
</p>

<p>
"Not He!"  The ex-Prætor bent his head reverently.  "Not
the Lord, but one who in visions has often seen Him.  The
Egyptian, called the Athlete of Christ, the Saint who founded
the Monastery of Tabenna which stands between Diopolis and
Tentyra on the eastern bank of the Nile.  For this house, now
under the rule of the venerable Abbot Pachomius, was built
upon the ruins of a tomb or temple of the bygone people,
where the Saint, to enjoy contemplation of things Divine, lived
in solitude as a hermit for twenty years.  Now his eyrie is
upon a high mountain looking towards the fastnesses of
Sinai and the Red Sea.  Once, he came down&mdash;during the
persecution of Diocletian, and travelled to Alexandria with
the chain-gangs of Christians, being brought to the city to
confess their Faith and die.  No man laid a hand on him,
though he went in and out of the prisons freely, bringing
clothes and food and medicine; tending the sick and comforting
the wretched, preaching and exhorting openly, showing
himself in the Courts under the eyes of the judges, as though
he would have said, 'If ye seek me, come and take me; here
I am, here I am!'"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard of this hermit," Hazaël assented.  "He was
protected by some great person.  That is what was said at the
time."
</p>

<p>
"Then the people of Alexandria spoke truth for once.
He was protected by the greatest of all Persons."
</p>

<p>
Hazaël's face was as a stone mask.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"And so Christ's Athlete shows himself again....  Will he
escape this time, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
Said the Roman, not observing or perhaps ignoring a
peculiarity in the Jew's look and tone:
</p>

<p>
"He followed the captive monks from Nitria, not only to
bear witness to Christ in the prisons and churches, but to
confute and crush the heresy of Arius.  Each day in the Hall
of the Judges he stood up upon the left of the Catasta,
wrapped in a white linen cloth reaching from his ankles to his
middle, and mantled with the snowy fleece of his long hair
and beard.  He leaned upon a staff topped with the Cross,
and as the doomed were led away he blessed them, crying in
a voice that vibrated through the building like the sound of
a silver gong: 'Blessed are ye, called by Divine Grace to testify
to the Lord, even Christ Jesus!  On with a good courage! for
to you He holdeth open the Gate of Hope!'  None laid
a finger on him.  But the Chief Judge, in whose full view
the Athlete stood, called a lictor and said to him softly:
'Command that man in my name to withdraw himself from the
Court!'  And the Athlete, hearing this, cried in that voice of
silvery sweetness; 'I go from this place, O unjust judge! not
at thy command, but because I have discharged the errand
of my Lord.  My way leads through the Libyan Desert to
Scete in Nitria, and from the White Monastery of
Aphroditopolis to Tabenna; and from thence I return through the
Desert of Arabia to mine abode.  Who would overtake me let
him follow; who would find me let him seek me in the ruins
of the Pagan temple that stands above the Limestone Torrent,
under the crown of the mountain that is called Derhor, standing
between the Arabian Desert and the Gulf of Heroöpolis,
looking across the Wilderness of El Ka to the Mount of Sinai!"
</p>

<p>
"And he departed?"
</p>

<p>
"He went out from the midst of us, no man daring to touch
even his garment, and I returned somewhat late, to find some
tax-gatherers of the Onophites waiting to pay gathered gold
into the Treasury of the State.  And to these I must
administer the oath, first covering my head with the lustrated
woollen cap, sprinkling incense on the coals and invoking the
Sabine deity....  And, as has been my wont of late, I
refrained from doing these things....  Then a man in mean
clothes rose up and pointed to me, and cried out: 'Question!
Question!  Is an oath made before a Roman Prætor valid and
binding, when the usage and wont of the sacred ceremonial
are scamped after a fashion like this?  Dip the olive-twig!
Purify the wool with the consecrated element! ... Throw
the incense on the coals, therewith invoking Dius Fidius!  Or
else confess that thou, Philoremus Fabius, art a worshipper of
Christ!'  Then&mdash;I do not quite know what came over me.  I
threw the cap upon the floor, and said to all present: 'You
have heard the Accuser!  Now hear me!  I am a Christian
man!'"
</p>

<p>
The Jew groaned:
</p>

<p>
"Madness.  Possession!  A casting away of reputation,
honour, and it may be, very existence! ... And for
what? ... You have never renounced the gods of Rome! ... You
have never been baptised by a Christian priest, or broken,"
he spat, "consecrated bread, or drunk wine at one of their
accursed love-feasts!  You have only mingled among them
unseen, in the robe and cowl of the Parabolani.  Idly listened
to a sermon or two&mdash;helped to carry one plague-bit to the
hospital....  Listen! ... All may yet be well! ... Only
consent to write plainly, stating these facts to His Excellency
Lollius Maxius, and to the Prefect Mettius Rufus, and entrust
both letters to me....  Upon my head and my son's head be
it if you find me fail you!  Hasten, O Master!  Every
moment of delay lessens the chance of averting ruin.  For the
sake of the boy Florens do this&mdash;if you will not for your
own!"
</p>

<p>
"My good Hazaël," the Roman said, as the Secretary thrust
tablets and stylus upon him, and drew forward his vacated
chair, urging him to sit down.  "To my shame be it said, I
have already appealed to the friendship of the Prefect, though
not in such pusillanimous terms as these you suggest.  Until
this moment I have waited for an answer in vain.  As for the
boy, these white hairs that have appeared upon my temples
since yesterday, testify to the anxiety I suffer upon his
account.  Being a child of tender years, you might claim of the
State in his name some portion of my confiscated property.
But in this case he will be placed under a Roman guardian,
and reared in the worship of the gods of Rome.  Better be
still!  Now tell me while there is time, what of your errand
to Ælia Capitolina?  Did you discover Annius Jovius Priscus,
the Senator, guardian of my late wife's property?  And does
her inheritance, the ancient Israelitish fortress, once given by
King Solomon to Balkis, Queen of Sheba, yet stand among
the vineyards near Joppa, or has Kirjath-Saba resolved itself
into a mountain of disjointed stone?"
</p>

<p>
The Jew drew a folded skin of parchment from his bosom
and gave it to the Roman as he answered:
</p>

<p>
"I found the man you bade me seek, in the city that was
once Jerusalem!  As for the tower of Kirjath-Saba, it stands
as though fresh wars might yet rage and beat upon its
ruggedness, and new nations arise and flourish and pass, yet leave
it there unharmed.  Here, sent to thee by the Senator Priscus,
are the writings made when the Tower with the land about
it, was conferred upon the Tribune Justus Martius of the
Tenth Roman Legion, by decree of the Emperor Vespasian,
on the tenth day of the month of August, in the second year
of his reign."
</p>

<p>
Philoremus murmured, scanning the faded ink characters
upon the sheepskin:
</p>

<p>
"Justus Martius, ancestor of my wife, led a party of Roman
Legionaries with scaling-ladders in the siege of Titus against
Antonia.  He found a breach in the fortress-wall, got through
and killed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël nodded grimly:
</p>

<p>
"Ay, killed the Jewish sentries, and slew the rest of the
defenders.  That was the beginning of the Massacre and the
Destruction&mdash;to which that of Nebuchadnezzar the Assyrian,
was as a passing shower to the fury of a storm.  With this
deed I have to deliver back to you the signet ring with the
head of Hercules, cut in intaglio upon a black agate, that I
carried with me into Palestine; and also my pack-mule's burden
of two thousand sestertia, in good <i>aurei</i> of Hadrian, at 30
to the pound of gold; and with the money a message from
Priscus."
</p>

<p>
"Keep the black onyx intaglio in memory of me.  The
fellow ring&mdash;the same head cut in relief&mdash;is in the coffer with
my dear wife's jewels.  Worn by her from her marriage until
her death, it will be a precious legacy for Florens.  Give it
him when he shall have reached the age of nineteen.  Take the
parchment also and keep it in trust for my son, and the
mule-load of money, for I have no need of these."  As the
sheep-skin vanished under the Jew's upper garment, "Give me now,"
said the Roman, "the message of Annius Priscus."
</p>

<p>
"It was: 'Tell the husband of my departed ward to find
another steward to husband her vineyards of Kir Saba and
receive the grape-money from the wine-presser, for I weary
of the dust and glare of Palestine, and desire to end my days
in my native city of Rome.'"  The Jew added: "I found
Priscus setting forth with his household and slaves to take
ship for Rome at Joppa.  Had I arrived at a later hour, my
journey had been in vain.  Wherefore, thanking the Most
High, Who had aided me in the execution of my lord's business,
I accepted the invitation of the Senator to accompany
him as far as Lydda, now known as Diospolis; from whence
I went to Kirjath-Saba, two days' journey by road.  There
gushes forth to water the green plains of Sharon a river of
fattening for the vineyards that stand about the Tower.  Six
hundred <i>schaeni</i> of land, I judged, measuring roughly by the
eye.  The two thousand sestertia I received represent but a
tithe of the value of the yearly gathering, judging by the fruit
that yet hung upon the vines."
</p>

<p>
"Old men are easily duped by smooth-tongued stewards."
</p>

<p>
"The rogue at Kir Saba is a Phœnician, and slippery as an
adder.  Yet will he not lose the stiffness of his back-muscles
and haunches until he shall have sacrificed a goose or two to
his goddess Tanit, and caused a slave to rub him with the
grease."
</p>

<p>
A spark of amusement twinkled in the tired eyes of the
Roman.
</p>

<p>
"You beat him?"
</p>

<p>
"My staff has an affinity with the backs of robbers that may
not be denied.  This one, by virtue of the authority bestowed
on me, I summarily deprived of his office; replacing the thief
with one Simeon, a Jew of Joppa, a faithful man and, moreover,
a kinsman of mine own."
</p>

<p>
"That is well if you judge it well.  And now let us speak
no more of money.  My son and his future are safe in your
true hands."
</p>

<p>
"Your son's father were also safe, were he to follow the
counsels of his servant," said the Jew with a passionate
eagerness.  "But consent to exchange clothes,&mdash;giving me your
purple-edged prætexta&mdash;taking this travel-soiled robe of mine,
this girdle, sword and dagger&mdash;this parchment deed and this
purse of money&mdash;and topping all with my mantle of camel's
hair! ... Let me sit here, covering my head and arms as one
that weeps, with the folds of this, your mantle!"  He caught
up a fur-trimmed hooded outer garment of crimson that lay
upon a neighbouring chair.  "Pass the guards!&mdash;in your
disguise the thing may be done, I swear it!  Hasten to my house.
Give to my wife a written line from me&mdash;here are inkhorn,
reed and paper&mdash;and she will deal with you faithfully even
as myself.  Consent!  Accept!"
</p>

<p>
"The sacrifice of your life for mine!  A thousand times
No!" said the ex-Prætor, sternly.
</p>

<p>
Hazaël urged in a low, fierce voice, illustrating his speech
with rapid gestures towards the window; pointing to the
helmed head, muscular brown neck and powerful shoulders
of the Legionary posted in the loggia beyond.
</p>

<p>
"My life will be in no peril.  I swear to you I will but make
sure that you have passed out safely, before I leap upon the
guard there, stab one&mdash;strangle the other&mdash;and escape.  Once
in the Jews' Quarter I am safe as you will be.  By a hundred
avenues known to none but the Chosen we can escape from
Alexandria.  Only consent&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But the Roman was firm in his refusal.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you wish to die, it is clear to me!" exclaimed Hazaël.
"The thirst for death consumes you even as those other
Christians, who think the heavens will open amidst their tortures
and the Crucified appear, surrounded by the Shekinah; and
extending His nail-pierced hands to them; whilst hovering
angels offer them the martyr's crown!"
</p>

<p>
"You forget, I am not even baptised," said the Roman.  "I
have not received the instruction of a catechumen.  I have
abjured the gods of Rome without knowing whether Christ
will accept me....  And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His calmness made the Jew shudder.  He looked from the
window with a glance that sought above the palm-trees and
acacias, the blue sky, crossed and recrossed by the airy dance
of the swallows, and said with a smile:
</p>

<p>
"And yet I have never experienced such wondrous peace of
mind.  An ichor runs in my veins that is clear as crystal, cool
as snow and yet glowing as the fire of sunset....  Never
have I tasted in my life a joy so deep as this!"
</p>

<p>
"He is mad!" groaned Hazaël in his anguished heart.  But
the ex-Prætor was again speaking:
</p>

<p>
"Listen, most dear and faithful friend! ... Should that
thing happen which means that I am not quite rejected, being
permitted to die for the faith of Christ,&mdash;take my boy, secretly
as I have said, to the Abbot of Tabenna, and explain that I
wish Florens to be baptised and reared in the Christian faith."
He went on as the Jew's face again darkened, and his eyes
once more dilated with horror, "Should Florens shrink from
the life of a monk, let him be a soldier, like the father who
sends him his blessing.  Deposit my wife's jewels with the
Abbot of Tabenna,&mdash;to be sold for the boy's benefit&mdash;all save
the fellow-ring to the signet I have given you&mdash;which is to be
Florens' when he is of age.  Tell him that the Hercules must
stand for manliness and valour; the knotted club for Truth
and Honesty; and the lion's skin for the wisdom that cloaks
itself against the malice of the world in the experience of
trials overpast."
</p>

<p>
"I will remember!" the Jew said sullenly.  "Have I all your
instructions? ..."
</p>

<p>
"There is but one thing more!" the Roman returned, speaking
low and hurriedly.  "The boy being left with the Abbot
at the Monastery of Tabenna, I entreat you to return by way
of the Arabian Desert, seek out the hermitage of Christ's
Athlete upon Mount Derhor and deliver to the Blessed One a
message from me.  Say to the Saint: 'I bring greetings from
Philoremus Fabius, once Prætor of the Taxes of Egypt in
Alexandria.  Without having formally embraced Christ, or
received the waters of baptism, this man has testified to the
Faith and died!' ... Further, say: 'He entreats thee to pray
that his sins may be forgiven.  And that for him also the Hand
that was pierced may open the Gate of Hope!'..."  He added,
visibly paling as the distant sound of a trumpet broke upon his
utterance, "All is now said.  And it is well, for that is the
trumpet-call of the Prefect's Bodyguard.  My examination
takes place before the banquet, it may be!  Well, well!  I have
no envy of the flower-crowned guest whose place should have
been mine!"
</p>

<p>
Again the trumpet shrilled, and the two men sat in silence,
as the rhythmical tread of wooden-soled, heavy-nailed sandals
falling on the pavement of the street drew nearer,&mdash;grew
louder until the solid walls vibrated: and then&mdash;as a harsh
voice, echoed by other voices, was heard to issue some
military command&mdash;stopped dead.  The curtain at the portal
bellied inwards with the draught from the opening of the
house-door: and as the harsh voice issued another command, the
regular tramp of the wooden, iron-nailed shoes of the soldiers
wakened the echoes of the outer vestibule.  The Jew caught
his breath, and the Roman, frowning, laid a hand upon his
sinewy arm:
</p>

<p>
"No demonstration of anger," he said sternly, "I forbid
it!  And now, for this world, my son&mdash;for as one I have
loved you!&mdash;Farewell!"
</p>

<p>
"And O farewell, my kindest friend!&mdash;my generous
protector!" stammered Hazaël, with tears raining down his
bearded cheeks as they hurriedly embraced.  "May the God
of Israel so deal with me and mine as I deal with your
son! ... They come!"
</p>

<p>
The trampling iron-shod footsteps halted at the threshold.
The metal rings shrieked on the rod as a brawny, red-haired
arm, partly sheathed in glittering brass, thrust the heavy
curtains back....  Sunlight flashed from naked steel, and the
gilded plates of armour.  A Roman officer of the Bodyguard
stepped into the room.

<h3>
V
</h3>

<p>
In consideration of great services rendered to the Empire,
the ex-Prætor of the Egyptian Taxes was beheaded without
torture.  The body, exposed upon the public execution-ground
according to the law, mysteriously disappeared.  It was whispered
that it had been spirited away by persons with Christian
leanings, and secretly buried in the crypt of some unknown
church.
</p>

<p>
For three days following the death of his patron, the house
of Hazaël was strictly closed....  The Jew, with hair and
beard sprinkled with ashes, mourned, sitting on the floor in
a coarse black tunic, rent at the hem; and observing silence,
ate bread and drank water once a day at the sunset hour.  He
even said Kaddish for his dead benefactor, though an act so
presumptuous would have scandalised the Rabbinate.  On the
fourth day he rose: washed and reclothed himself, and
returned to his family as though nothing had transpired.  But
on a day following the celebration of the Feast of
Tabernacles, the large white mule on which Hazaël made his
journeys, with the beast that usually carried his attendant Ephraim,
stood waiting with the pack-mule at the Chief Secretary's
door.
</p>

<p>
A long basket of woven osiers now being brought out by
Ephraim and another servant, and carefully strapped upon the
burden of necessaries carried by the pack-mule, the Chief
Secretary, armed as before, and in the plain travelling garb
that he had worn previously, bade farewell to his wife and
family; thrust his mighty bronze-shod staff once more into
its leathern bucket; and rode out of the City of the Pharos
with his small following, by the Gate of the Moon.
</p>

<p>
A flat-bottomed boat paddled by four negroes, conveyed both
men and beasts across the vineyard-fringed Lake of Mareotis,
and for some miles south-eastwards along the Canal of
Alexandria, between palm-groves, gardens, orchards and the estates
of wealthy Greeks, Egyptians and Roman officials.  Above
Andron, the ancient city fast falling through Roman misrule
into neglect and dilapidation, the party landed; Hazaël gave
money to the master of the rowers, received his salutations,
and the four negroes, reversing their positions, soon conveyed
the boat away.
</p>

<p>
Then the Jew, no longer hiding the anxiety that had
devoured him, leaped with fierce energy upon the pack-mule,
unstrapped the heavy osier basket and with the aid of Ephraim,
carefully lowered it to the ground.  With shaking hands he
unfastened the lid of the pannier, and as the smiling but
bewildered face of a boy of twelve years old looked up at him,
with blue eyes blinking in the sudden glare of the sun:
</p>

<p>
"Now thanks be to the Holy One that all is well with thee!"
he stammered.  "Not a word, not a movement&mdash;your father's
true son!  See now&mdash;this pad from under thy head, my hands
beneath thy armpits.  Leap&mdash;and fresh as a salmon from the
British Thamesis&mdash;a sturgeon from the Hyperborean Ocean,
or a lamprey from Lake Moeris&mdash;out you come!"
</p>

<p>
He hugged the boy against his breast with almost womanly
tenderness, and running his hands rapidly over the slight
body, assured himself that all was well.  Then mounting
Florens before the saddle of his own mule, and followed by
Ephraim with the other animals; the Secretary, following a
southward-running road that crossed some ripening cotton-fields,
presently drew the rein, and looked back at Ephraim,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"The idolaters are true to their word.  See, there are their
tents and camels!"
</p>

<p>
And he pointed to where low black tents were pitched upon
a stretch of scrubby ground lying between the crop-land and
the reddish-coloured desert, upon which camels eagerly grazed
upon withered vetch and wiry grasses; while a small band of
Saracens crouched round a small fire, wrapped in capacious
mantles woven of white wool and black camel's hair, their
loaded staves beside them, and sharp broad-bladed spears
planted haft downwards in the ground near by.
</p>

<p>
The Saracens rose, seeing men on beasts coming, seized
their staves and plucked forth their spears.  Then, comprehending
who it was that approached, their demeanour altered,
and they received the Jew with respect.
</p>

<p>
"I am Mafa Oabu," said the eldest of the company.  "If
evil come to thee, or those who are thy companions, I pay to
him whom thou knowest, with my life and the lives of my
sons!"
</p>

<p>
He touched himself with the right hand upon the breast
and brow, and laid his hands in the hands of Hazaël, as also
did the men of his following.  Three young camels were
chosen for the travellers to ride.  Two others were loaded
with the water-skins, provisions, fodder, and baggage.  Mafa
Oabu mounted one of the pack-animals.  Two strong young
men, marching with the caravan, would ride by turns upon the
other, the old Saracen said, when either of them required
rest.  As for the mules, they remained in the keeping of the
Saracens, to be reclaimed upon the return of the travellers.
The price of the journey, not to be paid until then, was to be
one hundred silver <i>sestertii</i> a day for each of the five camels;
fifty <i>sestertii</i> for Mafa Oabu, and a gift for each of the young
men.
</p>

<p>
The departure was accompanied by shrill ululating cries
made by the women of the Saracens, who kept veiled their
faces, painted like their naked bodies with green and scarlet
fishes, serpents and the signs of the Zodiac, and smeared their
hair with butter.  Then the caravan struck southwards into
the Nitrian Desert.  That night they encamped under a grove
of palm-trees, near a Roman well hollowed in the living rock,
amidst the bellowings of the camels, which purposely had not
been watered before the start.
</p>

<p>
Water-skins brought by the Jews being filled by Ephraim,
that the pure element might not be contaminated by the
touch of idolaters, the Saracens filled their own, and drew
water for the camels, which was given the thirsty beasts in a
pitch-smeared skin trough.  Mafa Oabu took no share in these
labours, but prostrating himself upon the sand with his
forehead towards the setting sun, remained absorbed in silent
adoration.  The Jews washed, gave thanks and ate; sharing
with the child the bread, eggs, figs and dried fish they had
brought with them; drinking a little wine diluted with water,
and keeping their own side of the fire.  The Saracens washed
down their sparing diet of dried bread, dates and sheeps'-milk
cheese with a drink of charred corn, crushed, and boiled
in water mingled with honey, which they sipped from the
shells of young tortoises, showing their white teeth in smiles
at the hearty appetite displayed by the child.  Yet while the
novelty of all about him pleased and excited Florens, he would
pause in the midst of a mouthful to ask Hazaël:
</p>

<p>
"When we reach where we are going, shall we find my
father there?"
</p>

<p>
"If the Almighty so wills!" was the Jew's invariable answer.
The young Saracens, whose names were Marduk and Belias,
pitched a black tent to shelter the travellers, when sleeping,
from the rays of the new moon.  Small, marvellously bright
and silvery, it hung high in the south, rivalling the blue
radiance of Jupiter, the evening star....  In the north-west the
Pharos of Alexandria blazed on the horizon at intervals of an
instant.  Hazaël looked at the distant splendour of the city, and
muttered, as he thought of his benefactor murdered there:
</p>

<p>
"But for the Chosen, and my Miriam and my children, who
dwell in the shadow of thy painted temples like to doves
among the rocks, I could wish that fire and brimstone might
descend from Heaven and consume thee utterly, thou thrice
accursed Harlot of the Sea!"
</p>

<p>
For in the bosom of the Jew, who had witnessed massacres
of Christians without a sentiment of pity or horror, the
commission of that single crime had caused a strange revulsion.
Before he lay down, he looked at the boy, who wearied, was
soundly sleeping; and a heavy tear dropped from his stern
eyes upon the woollen covering he held back.  Then he
replaced it over the tossed curls and the flushed face of the
sleeper, commended himself to the Almighty care, and
stretched himself upon the ground beside Florens.
</p>

<p>
Rising to repeat the Shema for the first night-watch, he
stepped outside the tent to leave to Ephraim, who had also
wakened, the freedom of solitude which intensifies prayer.
The young Saracens slept beside the pink embers of the fire,
enveloped in their mantles of camel's hair.  Mafa Oabu did
not sleep, but sat apart, alert and wakeful; spear at hand and
staff in readiness; his sling lying beside him, with a supply of
rounded stones.
</p>

<p>
Placing ten small pebbles in front of him, he reckoned that
ten days must pass before the arrival of the caravan at
Memphis.  Adding ten more for the return-journey, he
surrounded each of the twenty pebbles with five hundred grains
of maize, reckoning up his gains by the light of the moon
and of the fire&mdash;which he often fed with dead wood and dried
camel's-dung&mdash;regularly discovering to his chagrin that he had
not added the sum due for his own labours, and must begin
once more.  When the stars began to pale towards the dawn,
he ceased, and prostrated himself, rising to find Hazaël
standing near.
</p>

<p>
"What do you worship?" the Jew asked him.
</p>

<p>
"We pray," said Mafa Oabu, "to the Great and Lesser
Lights, to the starry Hosts of Heaven and to the Djinns and
Afrits both good and evil, that eavesdrop at the celestial gates
and thereby learn much of the divine plans of Allah, the
Eternal, the Creator of All.  The brilliant lights that sometimes
shoot across the sky are in fact these beings, driven by the
Angels from the celestial threshold, whence their master Iblis,
the Peacock of the Angels, was banished when he rebelled
against Allah.  We also reverence as the holiest thing from
Kaf to Kaf, the pure white stone that fell with our father
Adam from the Garden of Paradise.  It is now no longer
white, having wept so much for the sins of the world, and
silver bands prevent it from bursting.  It is imbedded in the
wall of the Kaaba, the Holy House containing more than three
hundred and fifty images, built and carved by Seth, son of
Adam, and washed away by the Deluge.  Later, Ishmael,
guided by the Archangel Gabriel, discovered the marvellous
stone, buried in the mud left by the retreating waters, and
made new images in place of those lost.  We call the period
at which these events occurred, The Time of Ignorance.  You,
my lord, being of the People of the Book, the Sons of Isaac,
look back with ourselves&mdash;the People of the Desert who are
the Children of Ishmael&mdash;to Abraham, our common ancestor."
</p>

<p>
"So it is said," observed Hazaël, unwilling to offend the
master of the caravan, while he turned aside to spit upon the
sand, making a mental act abjuring kinship with idolaters,
condemned by the Almighty to burn forever in hell.

VI
</h3>

<p>
Keeping to the south, they passed that day through some
long-neglected orchards, lying upon the outskirts of a town
almost in ruins, sparsely inhabited by a degraded population
of mingled Greek, Egyptian and Libyan blood.  Satyrs and
fauns in the fig-groves pelted them with ripe fruit in return
for a volley of stones thrown by the Saracens.
</p>

<p>
"What are they?" asked Florens of Hazaël, puzzled at the
sight of these strange semi-human beings, sprung from the
iniquities of forgotten peoples; covered with hide, and having
horses' ears and tails, or goatish horns and hairy legs, ending
in cloven hoofs.  But Hazaël muffled the child's eyes and
dragged him roughly away.
</p>

<p>
The groves of the dying city left behind, the ground became
rugged, bare and stony.  That night the camels grazed upon
the <i>safsaf</i> weed, after the next they might have to rely upon
the fodder they carried.  A milky mirage made the scrub-bushes
of the distant plain appear as tall as sycamores.  Passing
through them, they barely reached the knees of the Saracens
who went on foot.  White snails covered them, glistening
like some strange pale fruit amidst their foliage.  These the
young Saracens gathered and threw into a bag with salt.  Thus
purged, they explained, these snails were excellent eating
either roasted in the ashes or stewed.
</p>

<p>
On their left as they travelled, a pearly haze tinged with
jade-green signified the vegetation of the banks of the Nile.  Ranges
of low hills in the south were vested in violet, and palest
primrose.  The sun smote fiercely, yet when the shadows of men
and beasts were shortest, the children of the Desert, as though
enlivened by the burning atmosphere, quickened their steps
and those of the camels and even began to sing.  They passed
through part of a petrified forest, the thickest trunks of the
stone trees being of the girth of a man's thigh.  A herd of
gazelle broke from covert, Mafa Oabu slung a stone after
them, and a doe followed by a young fawn fell with a broken
leg.  A Saracen slit the throat of the mother, and would have
killed the fawn also, had not the boy Florens begged with tears
that the little creature should be given into his care.
</p>

<p>
"It will die," said Hazaël, "without milk to nourish it!"  And
he signed to Ephraim, who took charge of the little
creature, meaning to slaughter it after the ritual of his people,
so that it might lawfully be used for food.
</p>

<p>
They passed Saracen grave-mounds and trains of camels,
and rested at another well where were more camel-trains being
loaded with iron vessels of water to carry into the Desert to
the military outposts.  Near the well was a fortress garrisoned
by Roman legionaries.  Roman officers driving chariots
hailed the Jew, with whom they seemed acquainted, to ask
the news from Alexandria.  The moon rose early, and rode
high before the caravan, as the blood-red disc of the sun sank
into the invisible western sea.  A mist rose from the burning
ground about the legs of the Saracens and the camels, so that
they seemed to wade through the waters of an opaque milky
lake.  That night the Saracens ate the meat of the doe-gazelle
roasted on sticks before the fire, and drank boiled broth.
And Ephraim killed the fawn, and dressed the meat in the
Jewish way, saving the delicate dappled skin to make a belt
and hanging purse for Florens.  But even the promise of the
belt did not pacify the boy.
</p>

<p>
"I would have reared it and tamed it too," he said, changing
colour: "You are cruel!"  Nor would he taste of the flesh
of the fawn, nor had Hazaël, in concern for the boy's distress,
any great appetite for Ephraim's cookery.
</p>

<p>
Dew did not drench the tents that night, nor soak the heavy
striped mantles worn by the three Saracens.  The breath of
the Desert filled the lungs, the sun poured down like molten
brass, the hard red ground ascended under the feet, and
travelling became difficult, owing to ridges of petrified coral and
banks of fossil shells and sponges.  Urged by the whistling
of the Saracens the camels exerted themselves painfully.  This
haste was of necessity, as the water began to thicken and grow
murky in the goatskins.  That night they rested three hours
and travelled instead of sleeping.  Before dawn they found
the track they pursued wind among low broken hills, rising
to jagged bluffs and full of yawning chasms.  When the day
broke, they perceived on looking back, these low hills
magnified by a mirage to a towering range of mountains.  Florens
cried out in wonder.  But the old Saracen made signs that the
boy should be silent, as Djinni, Afrits and phantoms of the
Desert inhabited the chasms, and resented the presence of
beings of the human race.  Skeletons of camels, and the
mummy-dry bodies of men were found upon the track they
followed.  Mafa Oabu said that these were the remains of
travellers who had offended the Djinns.
</p>

<p>
Now they descended a steep ravine, the sides of which were
clothed with petrified forests.  The pass ended in desert, the
hot reddish expanse of which, was broken by the glittering
shield-shaped basin of a lake.  This lake was salt, the Saracens
explained by gestures, and the travellers, who sickened at the
stench and taste of the putrid water in the goatskins,
moistened their cracked lips with a few drops, and turned away
their parching eyes from the tormenting sight.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the defile appeared now the white tents of
a Roman outpost, the eagled standard set up under a little
wooden penthouse, close to the quarters of the officer in
command.  A square wall of rocks enclosed the encampment,
which was protected by an encircling trench.  Not far off were
seen camels feeding, and the low black tents of a tribe of
nomads, of mingled Ethiopian and Arab race.
</p>

<p>
Now soldiers approached bringing water to the travellers,
yellow and muddy and full of the larvae of flies.  Filtered
through a cloth, they drank of it eagerly.  The soldiers were
fever-smitten, and covered with scabs and swellings, from the
stings of poisonous insects which swarmed amidst the herbage
on the borders of the salt lake.  Red fruit grew on tall thorny
bushes, a thin fodder-grass showed with the <i>safsaf</i> upon the
arid dunes.  Springs of the brackish water were to be found
here, by digging holes of six feet deep in the sandy gravel.
Wild-duck haunted the lake-borders; those of the Roman
soldiers who were bowmen, habitually shot the birds for a
change of food.  That night a black-and-white lamb, purchased
by the Jew Hazaël from the camp of the Ethiopians, was
sacrificed to the moon, and eaten by Mafa Oabu and his men.
</p>

<p>
They filled the water-skins with the turbid fluid, and left
the Roman outpost by the salt lake on the following night.
The heat grew fiercer towards daybreak.  Waves of burning
reddish gravel rose about them to the height of the head of
a man.  Mingled with the gravel were yellow crystals,
perfectly spherical and glittering in the moonlight.  The boy
begged to be allowed to dismount and gather these stones,
which the Saracens collected for the adornment of their
women.  To pacify Florens the Jew bought a handful or so
from the young men.
</p>

<p>
They crossed a low range of broken hills, and at noon saw
Mount Nitria and a mirage of two salt lakes.  Pied birds of
grey-and-white with long tails, appeared towards evening,
feeding on minute winged insects that rose from the burning
sand, and signalling to each other with sharp, whistling calls.
Jackals howled during the hours of rest, and, looking back
when they had quitted the place of their encampment, they
saw it alive with these foul creatures of prey.
</p>

<p>
Now the ground became paved with slabs of shining mica.
Bushes of wormwood, tamarisks and thorny shrubs with red
fruit, eatable by men and greedily devoured by camels, grew in
the friable red soil at the base of stony cliffs.  Herds of gazelle
grazed here.  Hills shaped like cones with broken tops rose
up on either side of them.  Towering rocks of black basalt
looked like giant Ethiopians menacing the caravan with
uplifted clubs and spears.  The full moon rose in radiance whilst
the sun was sinking over the unseen western ocean, amid
splendours of amber, topaz and ruby, sapphire and emerald.
</p>

<p>
They marched before day.  The Libyan sun had never
burned with fiercer intensity.  For fear that the boy would
swoon and fall from his camel, Hazaël transferred him to his
own.  The young Saracens ran by the wearied beasts, whistling
to them to march in line,&mdash;singing songs and jesting
clumsily to distract the thoughts of the wearied travellers.
Hazaël said within himself:
</p>

<p>
"When upon the hump of an accursed camel I fry alive in
the sun of Libya, shall I be solaced because a cricket chirps
at the doorway of mine ear?" Yet he pretended to listen with
pleasure, and bade the exhausted child take notice how the
shadows of the Saracens gambolled beside them like black
monkeys on the rocks.  But the boy, feverish from the bites
of the swarms of flies beside the salt lake, or sickened by the
muddy water, drooped more and more.  Sometimes he revived
sufficiently to reiterate:
</p>

<p>
"Shall we really find my father when we reach the
journey's end?"
</p>

<p>
Or he would vary the question by asking:
</p>

<p>
"Shall I have thy son Levi and thy little Leah to play with
there?"
</p>

<p>
To which the Jew, tender as a woman, and fearful of
increasing the child's distemper by thwarting him, would reply:
</p>

<p>
"If God willed it, thy father would be waiting to receive
thee.  If the All Highest commanded, thy playmates would
be there also.  All things are disposed and directed by the
Almighty."
</p>

<p>
"Where is He?" the child asked.  Hazaël answered:
</p>

<p>
"He is at the zenith and at the nadir.  He encompasses the
world with His fingers, and takes up His abode in the hearts
of holy and pious men."
</p>

<p>
"May a little boy see Him?  Shall I see Him?" the child
queried.
</p>

<p>
And Hazaël answered, groaning in spirit at the thought of
the eternal burnings destined for the soul of this innocent,
who must be reared in the heresy of Christianity:
</p>

<p>
"The Cherubim gaze perpetually on Him, and know no
weariness!"
</p>

<p>
The child seated on the pad before him, felt the heaving of
his breast, turned in his supporting arms, and looked up into
his gloomy countenance.  Then, seeing the black brows,
knotted over the bloodshot eyes, the strange convulsion that
twisted the mouth, and the haggard temples and hollow cheeks
bedabbled with sweat, Florens grew pale and stared at him
in fear.
</p>

<p>
"Are you angry?" he faltered, and Hazaël forced his brows
to unbend, and his lips to smile as he answered:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, but not with thee!"
</p>

<p>
"That is well," returned the boy, "for I would have you
love me as much as you love Levi and little Leah!"
</p>

<p>
"Then be content," said Hazaël's deep voice, "for even as
these do I love thee!"
</p>

<p>
Yet as he answered in gentle words, the spirit of some dark
forefather who served Canaanitish idols with bloody rites
ages before the Lawgiver received the Divine revelation upon
the holy Mountain of God&mdash;tempted Hazaël to pluck away
the sinewy arms that sustained the child in front of him&mdash;and
let him fall to certain death upon the stones beneath
the camel's feet.

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
After another day's journey over stones and thorny scrub-bush,
Mount Nitria and her ranges walled out the southern
horizon, while the Pyramids of Memphis showed small upon
the east.  The ascent grew more steep, then the ground sloped
down and the camels entered the Natrûn Valley.  Here <i>safsaf</i>
weed, tamarisk and thorn gave place to olives, vines and
harvested fields, upon the drying straw of which, camels, black
goats and numerous flocks of sheep were feeding.  Presently
the valley divided into two: at the bottom of one lay the salt
lakes, at this time of the year but six in number.  Beside the
lakes dwelt colonies of salt-workers who cultivated fields of
corn, vineyards and olive-trees along the banks of a waterless
channel that had once, according to tradition, formed a branch
of the Nile.  In the bed of this vanished river, and where
some of the lakes had dried up, huge bones of unknown creatures,
encrusted with glittering saline crystals, projected from
the salt-streaked mud.  These, the Saracens said, were the
remains of some terrible giants, sons of Eblis, Lord of the
Djinni and master of the Afrits.  Upon the further range of
hills rose the temples, pylons, palaces and streets of Scete, an
ancient city of the Egyptians, dedicated of old to the worship
of Horus the hawk god.  The suburbs to the east were
inhabited by Greek and Copt salt-merchants, their families and
their Libyan and negro labourers; but the magnificence of Scete
lay abandoned to foxes, bats and owls.
</p>

<p>
The Saracen master of the camels believed this place to be
the abode of evil Afrits, and pointing to some pillars of fine
dust set whirling by a breeze that was blowing from the
north-east across the deserted courtyards and huge empty squares:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"See!" said Mafa Oabu to Hazaël, "how the Accursed
Ones make sport here.  Beyond those groves of columns
topped with lotus-buds, within those vast palaces are halls
where the Sons of Eblis sit on thrones, crowned and immovable
with their stone hands resting upon their stony knees....
Women with the heads of cows, carrying the Moon between
their horns, look down on them.  Troops of <i>peris</i> carrying
flowers and ornaments, men with the heads of hawks,
crocodiles, and other creatures are limned on the walls....
At night they come to life, descend and serve the Sons of
Eblis, who between moonset and cockcrow are released from
their bonds of stone.  But all the rest of the time the place is
but the playground of the Afrits.  Evil is certain to befall us
if we pause to look on them!"
</p>

<p>
Right and left of Scete, on the shoulders of the hills, were
chapels and rows of cells, wrought by Christian monks and
hermits with infinite patience of labour out of the Cyclopean
rock.  Lower down a stream of pure water descending a
rocky gorge, made fruitful the fields and vegetable gardens,
the olive-groves and date-palms cultivated by the Solitaries
and the "communities with tireless industry and patience; and
manured by loads of rich black mud, transported on the backs
of asses and of men from the banks of the distant Nile.
</p>

<p>
Beyond these fields and gardens stretched the great Libyan
Desert.  To the south the massive battlemented walls of the
Monastery of Scete, backed by the distant mountain of the
Cow, rose from the summit of a flat-topped mound of red
gravel covered with black pebbles.
</p>

<p>
Seen near, this place resembled a fortress with loopholes
pierced in its Cyclopean masonry.  An ancient bronze shield
depended by two rusty chains from the wall beside the low
doorway, through which the venerable Abbot Melittus, with
three monks and two novices, had been led away to Alexandria
to suffer for Christ: and a stone hammer hung below
the shield: but it was not possible to reach the door, because
two millstones had been rolled into the entrance before it by
the monks: who had then re-entered the monastery by means
of a rope let down from a window above the door.
</p>

<p>
"Beat upon the shield!" Hazaël signed to one of the Saracens.
The heathen obeyed, but so long the monks within delayed
in answering the summons, that the child, suffering from
fatigue, and fevered by the recent bites of the innumerable
winged insects that swarmed in the neighbourhood of the salt
lakes, began to cry.
</p>

<p>
This innocent clamour evoked the apparition of a bearded
monk at the window over the doorway.  After anxious
scrutiny and much questioning, the monk vanished.  A pale
beardless face now appeared at the aperture, and a weak but
singularly distinct voice addressed Hazaël:
</p>

<p>
"O Jew of Alexandria!" it said, "we have now no Abbot of
Scete, until our Chapter nominate a successor to Melittus, who
hath been called, with certain of the brethren, to reign with
Jesus Christ.  But for the present, I who am called Paule,
serve as Brother Superior.  Tell me, therefore, what you seek
of us?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing for myself nor my companions, O monk!" said
Hazaël roughly, "but lodging for the night and tendance for
this child, who is weary with travel, and somewhat feverish.
He is the only son of Philoremus Florens Fabius, late Prætor
of the Taxes of Egypt in Alexandria, who&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let down the basket with Brother Theodore!" interrupted
the thin voice of Paule.
</p>

<p>
Then as a deep basket of osiers, containing a pleasant-faced
young monk, was let down from the window by a rope worked
by windlass and pulley:
</p>

<p>
"O Jew, give Brother Theodore the child of the servant of
Christ, Philoremus," said the weak voice of Paule.  "Happy
is the hour that brings us our martyred brother's son!"
</p>

<p>
Then, as the camel ridden by Hazaël knelt at a word from
its Saracen driver, and the boy, whose tears had ceased to
flow, willingly submitted to be taken in the arms of Brother
Theodore; and even showed pleasure as the basket ascended
with its burden through the air,&mdash;the Jew, unable to restrain
his surprise that intelligence of the manner of the Prætor's
death should have reached this distant place, motioned to the
Superior that he wished to speak in private.  And as the
monks drew in the basket at the window, and Paule leaned
out, the Jew asked:
</p>

<p>
"How can it be, O monk, that this was known to you?"
</p>

<p>
Paule looked down at him with luminous eyes, and answered:
</p>

<p>
"O faithful man! who for the sake of thine oath doest that
which is abhorrent unto thee, didst thou not know that the
great Saint, the Solitary of Derhor, rested here upon his
way to Tabenna in the Thebaïd?  Four days ago he left us,
having seen in a vision the confession, the arrest and
martyrdom by decapitation of the Prætor Philoremus Fabius!"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël said, striking his great metal-shod staff upon a
millstone so violently that the sparks flew:
</p>

<p>
"Where now is this Saint of thine?  Can a swift camel
overtake one who seems to have not only the legs of the
ostrich, but the eagle's wings?  For I have a message for the
man from my master!"
</p>

<p>
Paule asked, with his luminous eyes bent upon the
contorted features of the Hebrew:
</p>

<p>
"Does the message concern the child?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, monk, not so!" Hazaël answered, "for the boy is to
be delivered to the Abbot of Tabenna with certain jewels
which are to be sold for his keep."  He added as great drops
of sweat started again upon his cheeks and temples, and his
eyebrows knotted like breeding snakes: "He is to be baptised
and reared as a Christian.  These were the Prætor's last
commands!"  His great voice leaped up from him like a hound
unleashed.  He roared, striking his staff upon the stone
again.  "But better he should die to-night and be gathered to
his Pagan ancestors.  Yea, better ten thousand times!  Monk,
do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
Paule bent his small wrinkled head upon its fleshless neck,
and answered placidly:
</p>

<p>
"Jew of Alexandria, marvellous is thy probity!  Wilt thou
accept at our hands shelter and nourishment?"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël glared at Paule with bloodshot eyes, and angrily
answered:
</p>

<p>
"Monk of Scete!  I require from you neither compliments,
nor anything else.  There is a spring beneath some
date-palms a bowshot from your monastery.  There I and my
companions will encamp, unless the trees are yours?"
</p>

<p>
Paule smiled and said, shaking his bald head:
</p>

<p>
"Like the crystal water, the fruitful trees belong to none
save Him Who made them.  Rest there, and to-morrow at the
second hour come to me for news of the child!"
</p>

<p>
That night, whilst the Saracens sacrificed a black-and-white
goat in honour of their Moon goddess and to propitiate the
Afrits of Scete, Hazaël went apart into a solitary place in the
wilderness and prayed to the God of his forefather Abraham.
All night he prayed, kneeling with his forehead lifted to the
sky, or lying prone with his face in the dust of humiliation.
Then, remembering that when Joseph the Zaphenath-Päanea
was borne in the second chariot in the royal procession of
Pharaoh, the precious images of the false gods of Egypt
figured in these displays; and that Joseph, in exercising
vigilance over the goods of Pharaoh, was obliged to watch over
and faithfully preserve these idols, he rose up and shook the
sand of the Desert from his beard and robe.
</p>

<p>
At the second hour of the day he went to the Monastery.
The millstones had been removed from before the door, as
for an honoured guest.  He beat upon the shield.  Bolts
groaned in their grooves of stone, and the small but heavy
gate swung back upon its hinges, showing a courtyard within
a square wall, set about with small cells built of rough stones
and roofed with reeds.  Date-palms and fig-trees, with a few
olives were growing in a grassy enclosure about a stone-curbed
well, over which was a wheel with a windlass, chain and
bucket.  Upon the threshold of the gate was Paule, tall,
emaciated and with strangely luminous eyes, standing surrounded
by a group of other monks in similar coarse brown habits.
The Sacrifice was over, the board was beaten to summon the
brethren to the refectory, as Hazaël, frowning, stooped almost
double to pass under the squat archway of the gate.  But as
he rose to his great height the boy Florens came running to
him with so noticeable a return of health and vigour, that the
Jew could not repress an exclamation of surprise.  As Florens
caught at his arm, and raised towards the swarthy lips a face
all fresh and smiling, framed in fair locks on which light
drops of pure water hung glittering, Hazaël asked, looking
keenly into the clear eyes:
</p>

<p>
"What have these monks done to thee?"
</p>

<p>
The child frowned with an effort of recollection, and said,
pulling at a silken cord that now hung about his neck:
</p>

<p>
"Abbot Paule has given me a silver medal, and also a new
name.  I am now called Mark!"
</p>

<p>
At which Hazaël, seeing that the medal bore the Image of
the Crucified, and a reverse of the great Apostle of Christian
Alexandria; and comprehending that the drops on those
golden hairs were the lustral waters of baptism, thrust the boy
violently from him.  He turned red and said reproachfully:
</p>

<p>
"Why are you always angry with me now?"
</p>

<p>
That night the caravan left Scete.  Travelling southwards
they came before dawn to the camel-route running between
the Oasis of Ammon and the Nile, and thenceforward
followed it to the east.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the camels and the Saracens to await them at
Memphis, the two Jews with the boy entered the sailing-vessel
of some Coptish sailors, who for a certain sum conveyed them
up the river to Tabenna.  This place, the boatmen told the
boy, was once Taben-Isi, the City of Isis.  The religious house
ruled by Abba Pachomius was built of great stones which
had once formed part of the ancient temples.  Thirteen
hundred monks of the tonsure were under Pachomius in the
Monastery of Tabenna; and in the mountains of that region
were many other monasteries and nunneries, also seven
thousand hermits, following their several Rules in their own
cells, there waging war against the world, the flesh and Satan;
or living in tombs and caves after the method of the Athlete
of Christ.
</p>

<p>
"Who is the Athlete of Christ?" the child asked the boatmen.
</p>

<p>
The Copts looked at the Jews, and observing that Hazaël
listened, they were troubled, because they were Christians.
But Hazaël said to them:
</p>

<p>
"Speak without fear.  As the Most High lives, I will not
betray you!  This is a Christian child, my master's son, I
carry to the monks."
</p>

<p>
Then the boatmen told of the deeds of Christ's great servant,
the Egyptian, who had been born of wealthy parents near
Aphroditopolis, and upon their death inheriting their lands
and wealth, had given all to the poor, crossed the River, and
became a Solitary; living first in an empty tomb in a
burial-place hewn by the ancients out of the mountain, being
supplied by a peasant man who visited him, with bread, salt and
water, weaving ropes of palm-leaves and sleeping on the
bare ground.
</p>

<p>
"Here," said the master of the boat, "the Adversary
appeared to this holy man tempting him; and devils, sent by the
lord of devils, assailed him with execrations and blows, whilst
apparitions continually beset him, in the shape of lions,
wolves, hyænas, serpents and other reptiles&mdash;which he
banished by the power of the Word.  Then, still a young
man, he went out alone into the Desert and there lived in a
ruined temple that was in the mountains above Panopolis for
more than twenty years.  In time his fame drew all the monks
that were then in Egypt, and great folks and the curious, and
those who were sick."
</p>

<p>
"And," said the other Copt, "when the Saint would not
show himself to them, they lifted the gate out of its hinges,
threw themselves down on their faces, and supplicated: 'Man
of God, come forth!'  And when he came, he seemed to those
that had known him, as young as when he had entered.  His
look converted, his touch healed, his speech was exceedingly
wonderful.  And in the might of the grace that was given
them, the monks reared a great Monastery near Panopolis
that they might live there in holiness and be ruled by this
Blessed One.  But sixteen years ago he withdrew himself by
the Desert of Arabia into the upper fastnesses of the
mountain called Derhor, leaving another to be their Abba and
spiritual guide.  Since when, all here is quiet, though of old,
even to men passing in their vessels on the river, the sound
of great tumult and hideous outcries used to come down from
the rocky eyrie where this eagle of God had made his nest.  In
the time of the first Persecution of the Christians by the
Emperor, he descended from his mountain and went down to
Alexandria to minister to the Confessors in prison there.  He
wished, they say, for martyrdom, but it was denied him.  This
very year, before the grapes and mulberries were ripe&mdash;when
the Roman soldiers came to Tabenna, and the monks withstood
them with boiling pitch and scalding water&mdash;they had
sight of the Saint again!"
</p>

<p>
"His white hair and beard clothed him," the master of the
vessel continued, "like a fleece newly bleached.  He stayed
but a few hours with the monks at Tabenna.  Then he came
down to the banks of the river, made the Sign of the Cross,
lifted up his arms and sang a psalm, both powerfully and
sweetly:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '<i>Come and behold the works of God<br>
  Who turneth the sea into dry land!<br>
  In the river they shall pass on foot;<br>
  There shall we rejoice in Him.</i>'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We have no knowledge that any one ferried him over, and
whether angels conveyed him we are not able to say!  But
almost immediately he was seen continuing his journey to
Alexandria upon the further bank!"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël broke out, forgetting his profession of tolerance:
"Surely you saw this Athlete, who in three strides can
traverse the distance between the Red Sea and the Thebaïd,
separate the waters with his staff like the Lawgiver of Israel, and
pass dryshod through their midst!  Or perhaps he walked on
the surface like the Nazarene Prophet, who was skilled in
theurgy, and did many wonderful things?"
</p>

<p>
The Copts were silent and exchanged glances.  But now
the Monastery of Tabenna appeared in the distance, seated
upon the skirts of the mountains, amidst groves of palms and
olives, reaching to the river's brink.  A great cemetery was
near it, with many tombs both old and recent.  A boat rowed
by Egyptians, carrying a bier, with a corpse swathed and
bound with garlands of bay-leaves and myrtle, and surrounded
by mourners, now crossed the bows of the sailing-vessel and
pulled for the Tabenna shore.  Monks in black robes, with a
cross-bearer and a boy-novice carrying a thurible waited at
the landing-steps to take charge of the body, which was that
of a Christian desirous of being interred in the cemetery's
consecrated earth.  As with the chanting of a hymn, the bier
was lifted from the boat and raised on the shoulders of four
of the brethren, the vessel containing the Jews and the son
of Philoremus, touched the land.  The monks moved on,
carrying the bier, the mourners followed, and the strangers
brought up the rear.

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
Seen in the distance the great Monastery of Tabenna was
not unlike an Egyptian temple set between the mountain's
rocky knees.  So great was it that the sight of its fortress-like
exterior inspired astonishment.  Without the house were
fields, gardens and orchards, and the Monastery, built
four-square, contained a cruciform Church, a huge refectory where
all the monks ate together; a school, a library, and a vast
warren of cells where the monks dwelt, illuminated by little
windows looking on the inner courtyard.  Seats were their
beds, for their Rule prevented them from taking their rest
lying down: they wore sandals of hemp, coarse habits of black
wool with leather cinctures, and skull-caps without nap, worked
with a purple cross.  The Abbot Pachomius was so bowed
with the weight of years, that the upper part of his body
was bent into a half-circle, and his face looked out from the
middle of his breast.  So many and so deep were the furrows
upon that countenance&mdash;Time might have used it as a sailing-chart.
Yet so kindly a smile beautified its ugliness, that the
boy went to the Abbot without fear.  The faithfulness of
Hazaël in carrying out so strictly the commands of his dead
master, while he would not even permit himself to enter the
Monastery filled Pachomius of Tabenna, as it had Paule of
Scete, with admiration of the man.
</p>

<p>
He said, having received the message of the martyred
Prætor from the Jew,&mdash;whom he received in the inner courtyard,
under a giant baobab that towered above the lofty walls
of the building:
</p>

<p>
"It shall be said of you, O Hazaël, son of Hazaël, paraphrasing
the saying of the Master: '<i>You entered not in yourself, but
him who would enter you hindered not!</i>'  Verily to one who
hath proved himself so faithful in this matter, much shall
be given by Him one day."
</p>

<p>
"All that I require," replied Hazaël, "is a writing acknowledging
the delivery of the boy to your safe keeping, and the
receipt of these valuable jewels which I now place in your
hands.  They are to defray the cost of Florens' living and
instruction, and the accounts of the rent of the vineyards of
Kir Saba, the boy's inheritance, I will render when once in
every third year I visit him in this place."
</p>

<p>
"If it be the will of God, friend," interposed the Abbot
gently, "for death spares not even the just."
</p>

<p>
"Should the Holy One, blessed be He! sever my cord and
cause the vessel of my life to be shivered on the well-stones,"
returned Hazaël imperturbably, "a kinsman will discharge the
duty in my stead.  Or my son Levi when he attains the years
of discretion.  Or the son of Levi, possibly."
</p>

<p>
"By the time thy Levi's son was ripe enough to undertake
the business," said Pachomius smiling, as he seated himself
on a stone bench beneath the shadow of the great baobab, and
stroked the fair hair of the boy who stood beside him; "this
little Roman might be a father also!"
</p>

<p>
"He is to follow his desire, whether he wishes to become a
monk or a soldier," returned the Jew, who had declined the
Abbot's previous invitation to be seated on the stone bench
under the towering baobab.  He delivered his master's
message concerning the black onyx, and continued: "And now
give me this writing of acknowledgment, for I must go upon
my way."
</p>

<p>
The Abbot drew from a leathern wallet at his girdle some
squares of papyrus, and said as he took a writing-reed and
an inkhorn from a shabby palm-wood case:
</p>

<p>
"Of eating meat I say to thee nothing.  But wouldst thou
depart without breaking bread or tasting wine in the house
of the Master?"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël answered, drawing down his black brows and scowling
at the Abbot:
</p>

<p>
"A Christian is a Christian, and a Jew is a Jew!"
</p>

<p>
Pachomius returned the smouldering fire of the glance with
a look of mildness.
</p>

<p>
"The First of all the Christians was the greatest of all the
Jews."
</p>

<p>
The dark face sneered, and the whites of the black eyes
glittered as the strong teeth flashed under Hazaël's tangled beard.
Pachomius added:
</p>

<p>
"Yet in the days of your youth, were you not nourished by
a Christian?"
</p>

<p>
"In those days my master worshipped Jupiter and the other
gods of the Romans," said the deep voice out of the thicket of
tangled black curls.  "If the camel that bore the beam that
killed my father, Rab Shemuel, had belonged to a Pagan
idolater, I would, in revenge of the mockery wherewith that
camel-driver mocked my father, have hated the Pagans, as I
hate Christians to this day!"
</p>

<p>
"So that is the bitter reason of thy virulence!"
</p>

<p>
Pachomius, seated on the stone bench, had finished the
receipt in rounded Coptic writing, and scattered upon it a
pinch of sand.  He was now waving the square of papyrus
gently in the air to dry it.  Hazaël went on, standing upright
in the sun-blaze, with his shortened shadow squatting like a
negro at his feet:
</p>

<p>
"The reason!  And from the cup of my bitterness since
manhood came to me, many Christians have drunk death!
Now it is clear to you why I accept no seat under a Christian
roof, O Pachomius!"
</p>

<p>
The Abbot's mild eyes looked out of the midst of the many
wrinkles, without resentment, only seeing the indomitable
honesty of this man.  The quiet voice said:
</p>

<p>
"You were Chief Secretary to Philoremus the Prætor of
Taxes.  It was easy for you ... I understand!  Had you
acquaintance with Arius the Heretic?" ...
</p>

<p>
The deep answer came:
</p>

<p>
"Monk, I know Arius the Presbyter.  And I have aided that
treacherous and ambitious priest to encompass his ends,&mdash;for
the serving of my own, that were righteous in the eyes of
Israel!"
</p>

<p>
"Was it then your aim to destroy your benefactor?"
</p>

<p>
The question shot like an arrow to the mark.  A dark flush
rose beneath the swarthy skin, and the mouth under the forest
of black tangled hair underwent a grim convulsion.
</p>

<p>
"The Lord on High knoweth that it was not!  For though
I was well aware my master went secretly forth in a habit
like that of the Parabolani, yet to mingle with the people in
various disguises had ever been his secret whim.  It was not
until I returned from a journey into Palestine that&mdash;" he
choked&mdash;"that I learned the Accusers had testified against
him&mdash;that I found him a prisoner under guard beneath his own
roof&mdash;with the seal of the Military Governor upon his
door!"
</p>

<p>
Pachomius regarded the speaker with compassion.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"It may not then be known to you that Arius accused the
Prætor in a letter sent to the Prefect of Alexandria purporting
to plead on behalf of Christians outlawed by Maximianus.
'<i>For,</i>' said he, '<i>O Mettius Rufus! if Christianity be a crime,
first banish it from your public tribunals.  How long is it
since your Prætor of Taxes has administered oaths to the
public without burning incense, and invoking the Sabine deity?
The Prætor's Chief Secretary, Aben Hazaël, the Jew, might
be able to throw light upon this question.  Indeed, it was from
him I gathered these interesting facts!</i>'"
</p>

<p>
A strange sound issued from the twisted mouth of the
hearer.
</p>

<p>
"O poisonous serpent!  Unclean, slavering hound! ... And
my master knew of this?"
</p>

<p>
"Knew, but would not believe that you could be guilty of
treachery.  Did not Philoremus receive you as cordially as
of old?"
</p>

<p>
The blazing eyes under the fierce black brows were
suddenly veiled with water.  Hazaël stammered as the heavy
drops fell and glittered on his beard:
</p>

<p>
"He opened his arms to me as a father! ... He trusted
me with his flesh and blood, and all the State had left to
him....  He never gave me to suspect by a word or even
a sign....  Give me that paper you have in your hand, for
I am in haste to begone from here.  I have yet another errand
to carry out for him!"
</p>

<p>
He struck his staff deep into the sand, took the papyrus,
cleared his bleared vision with a sweep of his hairy wrist, and
read the monk's receipt.  Then he stowed it in a wallet hidden
within the bosom of his robe, grasped his staff and looked
round as though seeking for something.  The boy, who had
strayed some distance away during the conversation, was
standing before a row of pens containing the pets of the
Monastery.  Some guinea-fowls, with knobs of horn upon their
beaks, and blue fleshy lappets upon the sides of their heads;
a large brown-and-white eagle, chained to a perch, who
observed his surroundings with half-veiled, ruby-coloured eyes,
and a pair of graceful gazelles, brought from the Arabian
Desert, enraptured Florens:
</p>

<p>
"Can they be mine? ... Shall one of them be mine?" he
asked breathlessly.  Then as the shadow of Hazaël darkened
the enclosure, and the Jew's hand closed upon his arm: "You
took away the other," the child said with a quivering lip, "and
told Ephraim to kill it for supper.  But you cannot take
away either of these, because they belong to the monks!"
</p>

<p>
"Even as you do, from this time forth," said Hazaël, with an
attempt at pleasantry.  "So send a kiss by me to my wife,
whom you wept so much to part with&mdash;and another to the
playmate Levi&mdash;and another to little Leah&mdash;whom you love
best of all!"
</p>

<p>
Then as the boy hung shyly back, estranged by recent harshness,
he caught him roughly to his breast, kissed him, pricking
his soft cheeks with the rough beard, and set him down again.
The gazelles instantly absorbed him: Hazaël was completely
forgotten: or else with the mimetic instinct of the child,
Florens feigned forgetfulness.
</p>

<p>
Then the Jew looked round from his great height for the
crooked little figure of the Abbot.  Pachomius was standing
under the wide-spreading branches of the baobab, with his
crossed arms hidden by his wide, loose black sleeves, and his
eyes closed as though in prayer.  He opened them as suddenly
as though he had been touched, and said, as though replying
to a question of Hazaël's:
</p>

<p>
"He whom you design to seek out is in the inner fastness
of Mount Attaka, below the dome called Derhor.  Take a
swift camel with bread, dates and water and a Saracen to
guide thee and lead the beast.  Follow the Desert to the North
for the space of three days....  Climb the path over the
Mountains and traverse the Great Valley of the Chariots of
Pharaoh towards the rising of the sun.  Cross the torrent-beds,
and follow the pilgrim-way that leads north over the skirts of
the mountains, the Gulf of Heroöpolis being upon thy right.
Then pursue the pass that ascends to the west.  This summit
is the gate of the Outer Mountain, where thou wilt find a
spring, with palms, a corn-patch and a garden-plot.  This
is the garden of the Athlete of Christ, who first broke the
ground and tilled it, sowing lentils and vegetables.  And
though at first wild animals destroyed the crops when they
came to drink water, he bade them cease from doing harm
in the Name of the Lord! and the creatures obeyed the voice
of His Saint.  Take what you need of the growing things,
they are there for the use of the Blessed One&mdash;and the
comfort of those pilgrims who from near and far resort to him."
</p>

<p>
Hazaël saluted Pachomius and said:
</p>

<p>
"Of the water I shall drink, for the Most High caused it to
spring in the midst of the wilderness.  But of the vegetables
I will not take, for the reason that you know.  Farewell!"
</p>

<p>
"Stay!" said Pachomius with sudden, unexpected energy,
"for I have more to say to thee, who art just and unjust,
generous and revengeful, savage as a leopard, and faithful as a
hound.  Hear, thou that consumest the children of Christ in
the flame of thy hatred for the man that killed thy father!
If thou wouldst pierce the fastnesses of the Holy Mountain
and attain speech with its Saint,&mdash;be not tempted to turn
aside by the sight of gold or beauty!  And forget not that to
him who endures all things in patience, the Gate of Hope will
open at last!"
</p>

<p>
"'The Gate of Hope!'  Who spoke to thee&mdash;who has told
thee?" Hazaël stammered, growing livid beneath his swarthy
skin.
</p>

<p>
But the Abbot made no reply.  His eyes were closed and
his lips were moving, as in fervent but inaudible prayer.
Some time had elapsed after the tall gaunt figure of the Jew
had crossed the courtyard threshold, when the eyes of radiant
light reopened in the brown mask of wrinkles, and the Abbot
of Tabenna sighed, and rose upon his feet.
</p>

<p>
"O Keeper of the Secrets of Heaven, and Conqueror of
Satan!" he said.  "How clearly thy voice came to me but now,
speaking at the inner ear.  And Thou, O Lord my God! how
marvellous are Thy dispensations!  Thy Wisdom, how
measureless, like the Eternity that sprang from It...."
</p>

<p>
He made the Sign of the Cross upon his brow, lips and
breast, as the board was beaten that called the brethren to the
church for recitation of the Second Office.  Later he ascended
the wall that made a fortress of the Monastery; and
looked upon the wide Nile, flowing north-westwards between
its borders of fertile land and the sterile sands of the desert,
studded with perishing cities and the crumbling ruins of
temples; mysterious labyrinths, petrified forests; banks of shells
and seaweed, coral and bleached bones of monstrous creatures
that bred in the primæval slime before the sea was separated
from the land, and their Maker created Man.
</p>

<p>
The sun of early noon beat down relentlessly.  Pulling his
cowl over his bald skull and shading his eyes, the monk looked
searchingly to the north.  In the distance a mirage created
a marvellous effect of blue lake, bordered by palaces
embosomed in groves that were reflected in the shining depths.
The broad stripe of yellow desert lying between the mirage
and the habitations, monasteries, gardens and fields that lay
about the ruins of the town and the Holy House of Tabenna
showed some caravans approaching, but the monk paid no
heed to them.
</p>

<p>
A moving speck, rapidly lessening in size upon the glaring
yellow distance, he knew to be the camel ridden by Hazaël.
A speck much smaller would be the camel-driver and guide.
In three days, travelling at that rate of speed, they would
reach the eastward-going track over the mountains, and
descend into the valley of the Chariots of Pharaoh.  Four days
more would bring them to the Gate of the Outer Mountain
and the spring of the Athlete of Christ.
</p>

<p>
"I obeyed," Pachomius thought, "the word of the Saint
without question, the message coming to me from him who
is the chosen messenger of God.  Yet sinful as I am, I
question now, and wonder.  Why, O Holy One, didst thou but now
command me to warn this relentless Jew&mdash;who like another
Saul of Tarsus digs pits and traps for the destruction of
Christians!&mdash;as though the stubborn enemy of Christ were to
be tempted like a Christian Saint?  Surely the Calumniator,
knowing this man Hazaël for his own&mdash;will not trouble to
ensnare him?  Never have I encountered a soul more
upright&mdash;or more remote from grace!"
</p>

<p>
A thrill Pachomius knew well, passed through his breast
into his inner being.  Not for the first time by many, a voice
well-known, reduced by distance to a gossamer thread of
infinite tenuity, spoke at the Abbot's inner ear.
</p>

<p>
"And if, even as that Saul who slew the Prophets, the Lord
hath chosen such a man to be His servant, shall not the Judge
of all the world do righteously?  And if this man, blinded by
pride and wrath, reject the offered grace&mdash;turn from the Light,
and quit the threshold ere the Gate be opened&mdash;shall He Who
planted in the human breast the soul&mdash;that is a spark of His
Divinity&mdash;and dowered Man with Free Will that Man might
choose Him!&mdash;shall He be blamed because His creature hurls
back the gift into the Giver's Face?"
</p>

<p>
"I have erred!" said the Abbot, striking his breast&mdash;"O
Lord, do Thou forgive thy silly servant!"
</p>

<p>
And all through the rest of that burning day, Pachomius
knelt upon the wall of the Monastery of Tabenna, purging
himself of sin by penance, and praying for Hazaël the Jew.
</p>

<h3>
IX
</h3>

<p>
At the spring of the oasis at the summit of the pass
leading to the Outer Mountain, bronze-coloured doves, several
oryx, and a herd of wild asses were drinking, greyish-red
creatures these, white bellied, and marked by a broad black
stripe down the back.  The birds took wing, the beasts
scattered over the plain at the approach of the camel and its two
riders, who halted to water the animal and fill the goatskins,
and take food and rest.
</p>

<p>
Bands of painted, naked Blemmyes, the fierce Ethiopian
nomads of the south and eastern desert had shown themselves
occasionally, but made no attempt to attack the travellers,
whom they perhaps judged to be too poor to plunder, or too
strong, fierce and well-armed to be despoiled without exacting
tribute of life in return.
</p>

<p>
Before sunrise Hazaël and the Saracen camel-driver, who
had agreed to guide him,&mdash;struck northwards through a rocky
and difficult defile.  This was the opening of the road that led
to the inner fastnesses of Attaka, that stupendous mountain of
pale red granite, streaked with limestone, and sometimes veined
with porphyry, from whose summit, it was said, one could view
the distant Mediterranean upon one hand; and upon the other
look over to the Sinai ranges, across the Gulf of Heroöpolis,
that widens into the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
The region in which Hazaël now found himself was savage,
bare and solitary.  At the top of the defile the camel halted
and knelt.  The Jew dismounted and looked back.  A crimson
glow spread over the shining waters of the Gulf of Heroöpolis,
and every object possessed two shadows; one cast by the
sunrise and the other by the moon.  The yellow plain of the
desert, looking west, exhibited an illusory vista of cool blue
waters, out of which rose little islands plumed with palm
groves, reflected in the depths.
</p>

<p>
"Return," the Jew said to the guide, "and wait for me with
the camel at the spring of the oasis.  Yet first describe to me
again, in number and device as I shall find them, the various
signs by which pilgrims to the hermitage that is on Derhor,
may find their way."
</p>

<p>
He listened as the guide spoke, storing these things in his
strong memory.  Here a column of porphyry set up; there a
pile of oddly-shaped granite boulders; at the mouth of the
defile an arrow scratched on a limestone rock with a lump of
crystal; at the parting of ways a rude Cross fashioned of the
pieces of a broken staff, and jammed between two great stones.
</p>

<p>
"Swear to me by your gods," said the Jew when the idolater
had ended his recital, "that you have named these marks in
the order in which they come!"
</p>

<p>
"By the Face of Truth!" swore the camel-driver, who was
a wild and savage-looking object, with tangled hair smeared
with rancid butter; grotesquely painted of face and body; hung
about with charms and wearing a waist-cloth of gaudy colours
under his mantle of camel-hair.  "I have not lied!  Follow
these directions and you will return to find me waiting for you
with the <i>heggin</i>.  Yet pay me now the sum agreed, in case
you lose your purse upon your way!"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël reluctantly paid down half, and set out upon his
solitary journey.
</p>

<p>
The steep defile being ascended, the first sign was recognised
in the shape of a rude pillar of porphyritic rock.  This passed,
the surface of the ground began to be more gently inclined.
Heat radiated from the huge pinkish-granite boulders that
almost scorched the flesh.  The ground was covered with
blocks of this stone, between which showed the arid yellow
soil of the desert.  A scrubby bush with black stems set with
long white thorns, also tufts of seeding wild garlic and a spiny
red-fleshed wild cucumber, bitter exceedingly, with wild
fig-trees, grew between the granite rocks.  Wild goats with great
horns walked upon the verge of towering precipices and
bounded from ledge to ledge.  White eagles and huge ravens
screamed or croaked from inaccessible eyries.  The defile being
passed, the rocks sank down.  Barely a dry weed relieved the
barren aridity.  The yellow gravelly ground began to billow
upwards, and into the troughs of these billows the sun poured
down like molten brass.
</p>

<p>
Climbing over one of these extraordinary ridges, the Jew
made an astonishing discovery.  It was a dish or charger,
circular as a Gaulish buckler, wrought with the victories of
forgotten kings, and of the purest gold.  The love of the Semite
for this precious metal,&mdash;of which were carved the lions that
adorned the throne of Solomon,&mdash;plates of which covered the
Temple built by Herod,&mdash;and of which the Vine above its
chief entrance was gloriously made,&mdash;caused Hazaël's sight to
dim and his powerful frame to tremble.  Such a mass of gold,
all his by the right of discovery! ... He threw himself upon
the treasure with such eagerness that his foot slipped upon a
rolling pebble.  He fell&mdash;and the gourd water-bottle he
carried at his girdle was smashed into bits.
</p>

<p>
Moments passed before he grasped the full extent of his
misfortune.  With all his strength he could barely lift the
massy charger, which might have contained a wild-deer or a
calf roasted whole.  Sweat streamed from him, and a raging
thirst was aggravated by his efforts.  He moistened his throat
with a few drops of water left in a fragment of the bottle,
covered the golden dish with sand, and marked the place with
three stones.  Then he rose up and strode onwards.  Another
defile presented itself before him,&mdash;not leading upwards but
bending to the north.
</p>

<p>
To the south another opened, floored with huge granite
slabs, frowned on by precipices.  At its mouth on the left side
was a conical mound of rounded black stones.  Night rushed
down before Hazaël had decided which of these forbidding
roads it would be best to follow.  That indicated by the mound
looked the worst....  He was beginning to doubt the honesty
of the camel-driver.  If the hermitage beneath the summit
of Derhor was to be reached, he must trust to his own good
wits.
</p>

<p>
He chose the northern defile, and presently&mdash;with the rising
moon&mdash;came into a wide valley walled in by sheer cliff-faces of
limestone.  At its eastern side rose a precipice of coal-black
stone, down which appeared to flow a foaming waterfall.  This
appearance was caused by snow-white quartz, issuing like a
solid torrent from a point high above, and flowing down into
the rocky valley.  There was no way out of this trap but the
way by which Hazaël had come in.  With his agony of thirst
increased tenfold by the unreal show of water, he lifted his
arms above his head and savagely cursed the deceptive flow.
And as the echoes of his deep voice resounded from the
precipitous walls of the valley, he turned about sharply&mdash;for a
high whinnying laugh had answered from behind him&mdash;and
the clatter of hoofs, light and small as an ass's or goat's,
followed&mdash;galloping over the pavement of broken stone....
</p>

<p>
"Who laughed there?" the Jew cried, but no human voice
answered, and the moon was veiled behind a light cloud that
afforded no hope of rain.  When the planet looked forth, no
sign appeared of the supposed ass and his laughing rider; and
Hazaël, suppressing the desire to bestow another curse upon
the cheating torrent, made the two benedictions, and repeated
the Shema for the first night-watch,&mdash;fortifying himself
against the attacks of evil spirits within an iron wall of prayer.
Then he painfully retraced his steps through the defile
previously traversed,&mdash;munching the dates he carried in his
wallet,&mdash;as the dried bread without saliva to moisten it could not be
swallowed without pain.  And as he went, he slept by snatches,&mdash;often
wakened from one of these dozes by tripping amongst
boulders, or jagged sharp-edged stones.
</p>

<p>
Walking still with indomitable determination, he had just
repeated the prayer for the third night-watch, when he stepped
into daylight across the edge of dawn.  A dazzling play of
colour was smitten by the sunrise from the wilderness of stone
beneath and about him.  Broad veins of purple and greenish-white
porphyry, with red granite, and yellow and black limestone,
with outcroppings of snowy quartz, streaked the towering
sides of the defile: the stones and gravel beneath his great
travelling boots of hippo-hide,&mdash;whose heels of elephant-nail
kept him from slipping,&mdash;was composed of fragments of these.
Looking about he came to the conclusion that in sleep, or
during an interval of darkness, he had turned aside into another
path.  This led steeply up, and up,&mdash;the vari-coloured rocks
closing in until a mere streak of fierce blue sky between the
walls at the tops of the defile showed where egress might be
obtained.  To delay here was to die.  Therefore Hazaël
determined to go on.
</p>

<p>
Now, as he toiled upwards under the increasing torture of
the sunrays, delusions born of thirst and weariness began to
haunt his path.  The faces of his wife Miriam, of Levi his
first-born son and of his little daughter Leah,&mdash;rose up before
him in the vivid hues of life.  His dead master; the child
Florens, or Mark as he must now be called; the monk Paule
and the Abbot of Tabenna, moved with him among the scorching
stones, on which the lizard rarely basked; and between
which a few dry bushes lived without visible nourishment.
Through a strange roaring in his ears he distinguished the
voices of these phantoms.  Sometimes he answered them
without ceasing to walk.
</p>

<p>
He retained by this time barely the semblance of humanity.
His eyes beneath the beetling brows were red as those of the
captive eagle of Tabenna: and his long hair, and curling beard,
uncombed; tangled with burrs; soaked with sweat, and clotted
with the dust with which his ragged garments were covered,
had the appearance of a wig carved in stone.  Blood flowed
from cuts upon his gaunt sun-blackened limbs&mdash;sustained when
he had fallen.  He realised that without water he could not
now live long.  Should there be dew that night, he might find
sufficient relief by licking the stones, to endure forty-eight
hours longer.  Did no dew fall, he might possibly survive yet
another day.  What grieved him most was, that as the news
of his death could not reach Alexandria for a long time after
the return of Ephraim by way of the Libyan Desert with
Mafa Oabu and the Saracens; his son Levi&mdash;who had already
begun to study the Mishnah&mdash;would not say Kaddish for his
father for many moons to come.  And the thought of the
anguish of his widowed Miriam would have moistened his
parched eyelids, had in their dry and gritty channels one single
tear remained....
</p>

<p>
Stumbling amidst boulders, striding from stone to stone,
falling, dragging himself to his feet, and staggering on again,
the recurrent image of Miriam tormented him more sorely.
The fancy that at the top of the pass&mdash;where the rocks
approached each other so nearly&mdash;her well-loved figure would
appear with that square of blue sky behind it, became
conviction.  He bounded on, obsessed by the idea....
</p>

<p>
"Miriam!  My loved one! ..."
</p>

<p>
He breathed like a beast roaring.  His parched gullet and
dried-up lungs would barely admit the air.  He was bruised
from head to foot and wounded in many places; but beyond
that square of burning blue he would find&mdash;he knew it&mdash;home....
Home,&mdash;where he was welcomed as a King on each return
from a journey,&mdash;the rooms festively adorned even as on
the Sabbath!  the table spread with fair linen, rich porcelain
and costly plate,&mdash;the dishes such as he loved best; the thin
sweet Mareotic wine cooled exquisitely in snow....
</p>

<p>
"Miriam....  My wife!  I come!"
</p>

<p>
He heard a sweet voice singing....  He was nearing the
square of burning blue framed in the porphyritic rock when a
waft of perfume came to him, and a figure filled the frame.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
A woman, but not Miriam.  He stared at her blankly.  He
strove to speak, but his stiff tongue only clicked against his
dry palate.  His mouth gaped.  He drank her in with long
pants, veritably as though her beauty had been the luscious
wine of Ephesus, chilled with Mount Hermon's snow.
</p>

<p>
She was draped in a robe of fine Egyptian byssus with
crimson and purple borders, fastened about her rounded
hips, and drawn over her beautiful bronze-tinted shoulders and
bosom in many transparent folds.  From beneath an Egyptian
headdress of enamelled guinea-fowl's feathers her rich hair,
plaited with gold wire strung with orient pearls and other
jewels, fell down in broad bands on either side of her small
face of purest oval, from which piercing glances were launched
as arrows under eyebrows like ebony bows.  Her wide silken
trousers were red as the heart of a cut pomegranate; yet
shot with green and purple in the folds.  Her tiny sandals
were of white leather, ornamented with golden studs.
</p>

<p>
"O Isis!  Mother of the Dog Star!" ...
</p>

<p>
She veiled herself at the sight of the stranger.  The rich
amber and crimson tints of her cheeks and lips, glowing
through the diaphanous covering, suggested ripe nectarines
in a dish of frosted crystal.  Her long eyes, under their
jetty brows, were luminous and beryl-green.  The voice that
issued from her scarlet lips was as the cooing of doves in
the sycamores; as the gurgling of waters from the heart
of a mossy hill, as she continued: shading her face with an
amber-handled fan of red flamingo-feathers, and rocking with
her quickened breaths the heavy necklace of huge pearls
suspending an emerald talisman between her swelling breasts....
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, my lord! but you appeared so suddenly!  And O,
the gods!&mdash;being a woman unprotected&mdash;and this so wild and
terrible a place&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël knew that his aspect must be terrifying.  But the
perfume of roses that exhaled from the fair woman mounted
to his brain in waves of dizziness.  Hush!  Again the doves
were cooing:
</p>

<p>
"I am the wife of an Egyptian noble.  We live across the
Bay, at Arsinoë, but pass the vintage-months in our summer
palace at Aënus.  And&mdash;my lord is stricken in years and yet
desires posterity!&mdash;"  There was a dancing gleam of mockery
in the sleepy beryl eyes.  "We have visited the shrine
of the god at Pannias, but alas!&mdash;without remedy.  So my
lord commanded me, poor me!&mdash;to seek out the dwelling of
this Christian hermit, offer him rich gifts, and ask him to
pray for us to The Crucified....  Indeed, to be rich and
without heirs is sad for the poor old man, is it not?  Yet am I
to blame for this?"  She reared her little head upon the
rounded throat, and the beryl eyes blazed angrily.  "No, by
Hathor!  My lord Makrisi has been young and handsome;
even, dear stranger&mdash;" the feathers of her fan softly touched
the cheek of Hazaël,&mdash;"as thou thyself! ... Now is he a
withered branch.  And"&mdash;she shrugged&mdash;"would even the
fields of Egypt bring forth their abundance, without the
fertilising waters of the Nile? ..."
</p>

<p>
Insensibly he had approached, his long, heavy footsteps
setting the loose stones of the steep pathway sliding downwards.
His bloodshot eyes were at the level of her scarlet lips, between
which rows of milk-white teeth were gleaming; his bearded
mouth was dangerously near the wooing fragrance of her
bosom.  She sighed, and warm sweet fragrance assailed his
expanding nostrils, and caressed his parched temples and
cheeks.  And the heat of the morning sun was like the
downward draught of a white-hot smelting furnace.  And the
dazzling blue above and behind her seemed to burn in azure
flame....
</p>

<p>
"O speak again! ... Do not cease!" he heard himself croaking,
as though the cool, sweet, gurgling voice had power to
quench the thirst with which he burned.  She laughed
beautifully; and said, pointing with her fan to a great reed pannier
with a carrying-strap, set within the shadow of a deep cleft or
cave in the face of the porphyry rock:
</p>

<p>
"See how this surly Saint has treated me, a Princess of the
house of Schabak!  Look upon this basket of purple figs,
and black grapes bursting with honeyed ripeness! and green
melons with scarlet flesh dripping with cloying golden juice....
By Phthah! the weight is as much as my black slave Zet can
bear, and this man would not even open the door of the ruined
temple under the shadow of the dome of Derhor, where he
dwells with the Lili and the Lilith&mdash;the bat and the
screech-owl&mdash;and the great white eagles, and the falcons of the
rock&mdash;or answer me a word.  So I wept, I was so angered, and Zet
wept also,&mdash;for to carry the pannier down the mountain was
abominable to him.  And when we heard you coming he set
it down and ran away.  And for this he shall be beaten with
rods until the blood runs, when we return home.  Why do
you look at me so strangely, O Satrap? for I see by your
mien that you are governor of a province, in Assyria or Persia
possibly?  Am I less fair than the women of your country?
Have I no beauty in your sight?"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël answered in his thirst-cracked voice, with reddened
eyes devouring her:
</p>

<p>
"O Princess!  Even in dreams I have never beheld a woman
to compare with thee!  But&mdash;but&mdash;I am wedded.  A fountain
springs in the courtyard of my house, and a fruitful vine
shadows my threshold; and as apples of gold in a network
of silver, precious unto me is the love of my wife!"
</p>

<p>
He reeled as he spoke and clouds passed before his eyes as
though the steam of the blood boiling in his veins had rushed
into his brain-pan.  Blindly he sought to push them away.
And a soft small hand closed on his huge wrist, and his arm
became powerless and fell across her shoulder.  He swayed
like a giant palm-tree whose trunk is sawn through.  And
with astonishing strength the Princess supported him, saying
in that voice like the gurgle of cool waters:
</p>

<p>
"Thou art famished.  Men unfed ever talk of virtue.  There
are other things in the pannier besides figs and melons and
grapes.  Rolls of Egyptian flour, white as snow and light as
foam-flakes; and roasted quails in peppered jelly, wrapped in
fresh green leaves.  And meat-balls with spices, cheese-cakes
and saffron-curds, and bottles of cool Nile water and also
a flask or two of yellow Theban wine.  Let us go into yonder
cave and eat and drink together.  When thou art refreshed,
we will talk, or if thou wouldst&mdash;sleep!"
</p>

<p>
And the movement of her lips in framing such words as
"eat," "drink" and "together," had infinite allurement, but less
than "refreshed" and "sleep."  Her utterance of these bewitched
and bewildered.  Hazaël felt as one smothering in roses, or
sinking in the embrace of perfumed arms upon a bosom smooth
and cool as silk.  And realising in a flash his desperate
predicament:
</p>

<p>
"O Lord my GOD!" he cried aloud, "look upon my shame
and see my sorrow!  From the evil impulse, from the evil
companion: from Satan the Destroyer and from judgment,
do Thou in Thy Mercy deliver me!"
</p>

<p>
Whereupon the Princess Schabak with a burst of high,
whinnying laughter, skipped backwards,&mdash;and nimbly as a
mountain goat&mdash;leaped upon a ledge of rock jutting from the
cliff-face high above the level of the astonished Israelite's
head.  At the same time the pannier in the cave fell over and
burst open, disgorging a cataract of repulsive creatures; vipers
with horns, chameleons with popping eyes, lizards, tarantulas,
scorpions and huge brown bats,&mdash;which flying round and round
in the dazzling sunshine beat about Hazaël's ears with their
leathery, hooked wings and entangled themselves in his hair.
Deafened, appalled, exhausted and choked with thirst, heat
and stench, he fell down swooning,&mdash;fortunately for his
reason!&mdash;within the shadow of the cave....
</p>

<p>
When he revived, the rocky gorge was filled with the
crimson of the sunset.  The blazing heat had abated somewhat,
the fresh smell of water came to his nostrils, and he groaned
and opened his eyes.  Then he cried out in thankfulness to
God, Who had sent him water in his extremity,&mdash;for at the very
back of the cave a thread of wet showed on the wall above
a natural basin in the rock bordered with delicate black-stemmed
green ferns, that contained a draught or two.  As the
cool liquid flowed down his dried throat; life revived in him
newly.  He ate of his bread, soaking it, and also took some
dates.
</p>

<p>
Then he found his staff, went up the pass, and squeezed
through the narrow aperture.  The path now became little
more than a goat-walk upon the barren mountain's flank.
</p>

<p>
A vast prospect spread about and beneath him, upon the
right hand of the desert and the Nile beyond it:&mdash;with the
islands, cities, gardens, palm-groves, temples; the distant
cataracts, and the ranges of sandstone and syenite beyond the
towns on the Libyan bank.  Looking to the east his eye
embraced Mount Serbal and the terrible splendour of Sinai, the
Tih Mountains and Desert of Sin.  Nearer, he looked down
upon the Gulf of Heroöpolis,&mdash;the town at its mouth, and
the city of Clysma upon the plain of the promontory, with
the Wilderness of Etnam, and the Arabian Desert beyond....
North to Syria, bordered with the blue fillet of the
Mediterranean, his glance ranged; and then with a cool breath
fanning his brow, and stirring in the folds of his garments, he
lifted up his eyes&mdash;and beheld the immense round summit of
Mount Derhor, gleaming&mdash;white as though hoary with
innumerable ages, touched with the fading rose of the sunset
and crowned with the evening star.  A vast tract of snow-white
limestone, not level, but tilted at a steep angle, traversed
with innumerable waved ridges, crevices and fissures and
resembling a petrified cataract, spread between the traveller and
the base of the stupendous dome.  An irregular building,
like a Pagan tomb or temple, partly in ruins, could be seen
upon the dome's eastern side.
</p>

<p>
Desolation.  Not a grass-blade, not a bush, nor tuft of
wormwood found nourishment enough to sustain life in all that
arid region.  Yet here the Athlete of Christ had lived since he
quitted Tabenna; eating every third day of dried bread&mdash;of
which a store was left for him at the oasis every six
months&mdash;moistening the flint-hard cakes with water fetched from the
spring in a heavy stone jar.  When the water in the jar came
to an end too soon, according to the monks of Tabenna and
the Coptish boatmen, the Blessed One would eat the snow if it
were winter; or gather the dew,&mdash;soaking it up with linen rags,
or that porous fungus that much resembles sponge.  And
these he would suck, to quench the thirst that tormented him,
nor would he, were this relief withheld, descend the mountain
to fetch more water, until the arrival of the appointed
day.
</p>

<p>
Night fell.  So close together and so deep were the fissures
in the limestone, that Hazaël determined not to attempt to
reach the hermitage until the rising of the moon.  So he
waited, seated upon a boulder; a strange, wild figure, dishevelled,
scarred and bleeding; with battered weapons, and robes
dusty and ragged; burning with impatience to do his errand
and return to the oasis whilst strength remained to him....
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the Mount from its base to its summit was girt
with sheaves of towering flame of strange and marvellous
colours.  At the same moment a tumult broke forth of
indescribable and hellish violence.  Awful voices thundered
opprobrium, or wakened the echoes of the precipices and
chasms with shouts of hideous laughter, answered by other
invisible beings from the fissures in the plain.
</p>

<p>
"Filthy monk!  Scourge of the desert!  Master of wild
asses! ... Preacher to lizards! ... Awaken!  Rise and get
you gone out of this place!" ...
</p>

<p>
"Ah! ... Ah!" ... other unseen beings wailed in chorus:
"Shall we never be rid of thee, thou Dweller on the Threshold?
Begone!  Depart from us! ... Were not the desolate places
given to us, and the lands wherein no water flows?" ...
</p>

<p>
A frightful voice bellowed:
</p>

<p>
"Drive him forth!  Assault him!  Torment him with
serpents!  Worry him with jackals and wild dogs!  Borrow
the beaks and claws of eagles!  Bid the lions devour him!
Or if the wild creatures refuse, send against him from the
Shrine of Pan another furious Satyr! ... Beleaguer him with
phantoms in myriads of forms!"
</p>

<p>
And dancing fires girt the dome, playing over the moveless
waters of the stony cataract, and pale figures of wraith-like
mistiness, and dark shapes of mountainous stature seemed
to surround and hem it in.  And suddenly these appearances
sank down and vanished before the terror-stricken sight of
Hazaël: with groans, and yells, and blasphemies that caused
the hair to stiffen upon his head, and cold sweat to bathe his
limbs.
</p>

<p>
A flood of brilliance dazzled his eyes.  From the violet-purple
vault of the sky, in which the hosts of heaven were now
gleaming, a ray of Light, of indescribable whiteness and
luminosity descended, seeming to pierce the roof of the ruined
temple beneath Derhor's giant dome.  And Hazaël heard the
sound of a harp masterfully played, and a man's deep voice
singing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Let GOD arise!<br>
  And let His enemies be scattered.<br>
  And let all those who hate Him flee<br>
  Before Him!<br>
  Let them be destroyed<br>
  Even as smoke is made to disappear;<br>
  And as wax melteth before the fire&mdash;<br>
  Let the wicked perish<br>
  Before GOD!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When the psalm ceased the column of light faded into a
mild bluish radiance that lingered still above the dwelling of
the Saint.  Such absolute stillness reigned that the sigh of
the night-breeze, and the groan of a metal bolt in grooves of
stone, came to Hazaël across the distance.  A door swung
inwards; a light&mdash;not supernatural, but that of a palm-torch,&mdash;shone
across the threshold, and a voice, strong and mellow as
that of a young man, cried down across the steep expanse
of sinister shadows:
</p>

<p>
"O man of Alexandria, seeking here a sinner!&mdash;draw near
if you desire to, and do not be afraid!"
</p>

<p>
Hearing, Hazaël rose from the rock he sat on, and cried
back in a tone of wrath:
</p>

<p>
"I am not afraid, O Athlete of Christ!&mdash;if it be you who
speak to me!  But wisdom counsels not to ascend this steep
of perilous abysses&mdash;at least until the rising of the moon!"
</p>

<p>
Before his voice had ceased to echo amongst the stony
waves of the tilted sea of shadows, the strong melodious voice
of the solitary called back:
</p>

<p>
"The crevices are deep, and strange things abide in them!&mdash;and
there is peril as you say.  Yet if in the Name of the
Crucified you struck out boldly among these solid waters,
nothing of harm would come to you.  For neither earthly
dangers nor the malevolence of devils, have terrors for one
armed with the Might of the Cross."
</p>

<p>
Hazaël shouted back, with a dinning at his ear-drums:
</p>

<p>
"The Eternal One, who brought the Chosen forth of this
land of Egypt,&mdash;will guide me safely to thy door!  For it is
written that He does not forsake the righteous.  Have I not
in the strength of mine uprightness this day prevailed against
a Succuba?  Lo! before me the accursed demon fled, showing
feet like the split hoofs of goats."
</p>

<p>
The voice replied melodiously across the distance:
</p>

<p>
"Blessed and glorified be He Who delivered thee!  Glorified
and blessed be Christ Jesus, His only begotten Son!  Glorified
and blessed be the Paraclete, the Comforter!  Praised, blessed
and magnified be the Holy Trinity, One in Three!  Amen!"
</p>

<p>
Panting with defiance Hazaël thundered:
</p>

<p>
"The Lord is One!  He is holy and His Name is holy, and
the Holy Ones praise Him every day!  Selah!  Blessed art
Thou, Jehovah, the Shield of Abraham!  And blessed is he
who even as Rabba Jehudah, called the righteous, can lift up
both his hands to heaven, affirming that not one of the ten
fingers upon them, is guilty of breaking the law of God!"
</p>

<p>
He ceased, and the voice of the hermit answered, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Nay!&mdash;but a thousand times more blessed is he, who,&mdash;not
daring to lift a finger,&mdash;falls down prostrate before his Master,
crying: 'Lord, have mercy upon me a sinner!'  For it is written
that He pitieth the humble, and turns away His face from
the arrogant."
</p>

<p>
Now the moon, in her last quarter, rose from over the Red
Sea.  The limestone cataract, illuminated, took on a milky
whiteness, in which the innumerable cracks and chasms showed
like wavy bands of black.  Hazaël grasped his staff and strode
upwards, confident that within so many minutes he would be
pounding at the ascetic's doors.  But a dark cloud, not often
seen save in the rainy season, suddenly veiled the lustre of
the planet, and the Jew found himself standing in pitchy
darkness, upon an ascending ridge between two deep chasms,
unable to advance, or to retrace his steps.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a gust of wind rushed down a cleft in the mountains,
dragging at Hazaël's garments as though with invisible
hands.  A jagged double flash of violet lightning followed.
Dazzled, the Jew trod upon a pebble of limestone; fell&mdash;and
still retaining his grip upon his staff, found himself sliding
towards the brink of the abyss upon his left hand.  A
deafening peal of thunder preceded a flash still more vivid,
which illuminated the depths beneath.  With starting eyes
Hazaël beheld at the bottom of the gulf&mdash;which seemed about
to swallow him&mdash;the monstrous putrefying body of a creature
part-human and part-animal.  And the thought of tumbling
down to wallow in the Satyr's corruption, and share one
tomb with the shag-thighed offspring of unnatural and hideous
lust, wrought on the brain of the man so that he shrieked in
desperation:
</p>

<p>
"Save me, O man of Christ!&mdash;I perish!"
</p>

<p>
And heard the voice of the hermit answer calmly:
</p>

<p>
"Man cannot save, but only Christ!"
</p>

<p>
Upon which, as the lightning hissed and crackled about him
like flights of spears steeped in burning pitch and naphtha,
and feeling his strength about to fail, Hazaël groaned out:
</p>

<p>
"Then pray to thy Christ to deliver me!"
</p>

<p>
And hearing no answer out of the distance, he resigned
himself to despair.  But from some source unknown, strength
suddenly flowed back into him.  His brain cleared, and by a
sudden muscular effort he was enabled to draw back his body,
rise&mdash;and stand upon his feet....
</p>

<p>
"Thanks,&mdash;thanks!" he stammered out, as though to the
owner of some hand that had plucked him from peril.  Then,
in sudden anger, he dug his teeth into his lower lip.
</p>

<p>
The storm had passed.  The calm light of the moon irradiated
the immovable cataract of limestone: the Jew traversed
the remaining distance safely, and stood before the door of
the recluse.

<p>
The lotus stems of the pillars had been once crowned by
the sculptured heads of long-eyed women.  These had in course
of ages, by some convulsion of Nature or by the hands of man,
been broken off.  Their shattered fragments lay scattered near,
and the stone beams supporting the roof rested upon the stems
crookedly.  The door-lintel supported a slab still displaying
the winged orb of Ammon Ra.  But through the symbol of the
Sun had been roughly but deeply chiselled the Sign of the
Crucified.
</p>

<p>
Hazaël knocked upon the heavy doors.  Of massive cedar-wood
strengthened with bronze plates, they would have resisted
the assault of a catapult.  The melodious voice said from
within:
</p>

<p>
"If thou that knockest art a being of the Pit, begone unto
thy master, Satan!  But if thou art a son of man, state thy
business and be brief."
</p>

<p>
And Hazaël cried:
</p>

<p>
"I am no phantom of the Pit, but the man who but now
spoke to thee!  Verily, as the God of Israel liveth, I speak
truth, and mean no harm!  Now open the door, O Athlete
of Christ!&mdash;for I have a message for thee.  But first thou
must give me water to drink, for my tongue is stiff with
thirst."
</p>

<p>
Upon which the voice said from within:
</p>

<p>
"Upon the threshold at thy feet in a wooden bowl, is water."
</p>

<p>
Hazaël groped with his hands, for the shadow of the wide
lintel shrouded the portal in blackness; found the bowl, full
to the brim; gave thanks, and swallowed the contents at one
long draught.  The Athlete's voice spoke again as the Jew
replaced the empty bowl, inverted, on the threshold:
</p>

<p>
"Jew of Alexandria, it had been wiser to have saved some
of the water.  For until the sun sets again, in fulfilment of
my Rule which I have taken on me, I neither open the cell
door; nor&mdash;unless in prayer to God&mdash;or in holy songs glorifying
Him, or in prophecies inspired of Him&mdash;utter one single
word, unless He bids!"
</p>

<p>
With a fierce surge of anger, overpowering his previous
sensations of awe, Hazaël struck his fist upon the solid
cedar.  He kicked it with his heavy boots of hippo-hide, and
beat upon it with his metal-shod staff.  No sound issued from
within, in answer to entreaties or objurgations.  Worn out
at length, the Jew sat down upon the threshold.  But then the
suspicion budded that there might be a rearward door of
egress, and he dragged himself to his feet and made the circuit
of the place.
</p>

<p>
In vain his toil.  No opening presented itself, except a chink
one might barely have thrust a hand through....  Stooping
and looking through this orifice he obtained a glimpse of the
interior of the dwelling, which was filled with a pale, bluish
light.
</p>

<p>
By this light could be distinguished the figure of the aged
Christian ascetic, tall, and so emaciated by fasting and watching
as to resemble a skeleton clothed with brown skin.  A coarse
white cloth which formed his outdoor habit had been laid
aside, and clad only in a sleeveless vest of haircloth, he stood
bolt upright, with joined uplifted hands, and eyes closed in
recollection, in a stone niche built on the left side of the door
of the cell; which contained nothing further beyond a mat of
woven palm-leaves, a stone water-pot lying on its side empty,
and a sickle, possibly used by its owner for cutting leaves and
reeds.
</p>

<p>
There was something so grand and imposing about the venerable
figure, with its white hair hanging upon its shoulders
like a mantle, and its snowy beard reaching far below the
waist, that violent words seemed profanation, and Hazaël
remained dumb.  The impulse to depart without delay was
urgent, when on drawing back his head and standing erect,
he became aware that the mysterious ray of celestial radiance,
sign of the intimate and wonderful communion between this
pure and fiery soul and the Divine Spirit from Whom all souls
have emanated, had again descended from the heavens upon
the dwelling of the Saint.  Venturing again to look in, he found
the cell irradiated, and felt a mysterious shock traverse him;
realising that the eyes of the Saint had opened, and were
gazing upon him from their ambush of white hairs.  And
they were the fiery eyes of a lion, and the radiant eyes of
a child, and the eyes of a man who has seen and talked with
Angels, so that it was not possible to support unmoved their
scrutiny.  Yet they were mild, kind and beneficent; and meeting
the eyes that peered at him through the aperture, the old
man thrice nodded his head.  As who should say:
</p>

<p>
"Although my Rule prohibits me from speaking, it does
not forbid me to listen.  Say what is in thy mind, and return
to the dwellings of men!"
</p>

<p>
And Hazaël cried to the anchorite through the wallhole:
</p>

<p>
"O Athlete of Christ!&mdash;I am a Jew, and from the bottom
of my soul I hate and loathe the Christians, but thou art a
just and virtuous man!  Now hear my tale!"
</p>

<p>
The ascetic nodded as though replying:
</p>

<p>
"Say on, thou hater of Christians! but be not over tedious.
For all my time I need for prayer."
</p>

<p>
And Hazaël cried:
</p>

<p>
"Listen then!  My youth was spent at the town of Acanthon
on Lower Nile, my father being a Rab, an interpreter of the
Scriptures, and a pleader before the Courts.  Small was his
wealth, yet great his name, being descended in the male line
from Ben-Hadad, King of Damascus, and in his veins on the
female side flowed the Royal Blood of Israel.  And one day
he was carried home to our house dead!&mdash;having been struck
upon the forehead by a beam of cedar carried through the
Lentil Market on the back of a camel led by a Copt.  And
the bystanders told me concerning the Copt;&mdash;that seeing my
father fallen and the blood from the wound covering his head,
the camel-driver mocked him, crying: 'Which wouldst thou
rather have, O Rab?  The beam thou hast in thine eye now,
or a mote?  Answer!'  And child as I was, I took an oath
to be revenged for that man's hard-heartedness on all Christians.
And to this day I have faithfully kept that oath."
</p>

<p>
He paused for breath and the recluse now answered:
</p>

<p>
"I know it, O Hazaël!  Thou hast been a very scourge of
Satan to the Servants of the Lord!"
</p>

<p>
And Hazaël cried back:
</p>

<p>
"Hear again, O Athlete of Christ!  My mother married
again, and my step-father was cruel, and I fled from
the beatings and the evil words, to Alexandria.  Awhile I hung
about the quays, living on stray scraps thrown me there, and
in the Jews Quarter, and then I met a noble man, a Roman
in the Public Service,&mdash;who took me into his household, and
fed and sheltered me.  I grew up under his roof, and presently
became his steward, and zealously I served him, using my
power when I might, to keep that oath of mine.  And knowing
not that my patron had secretly become a Christian,&mdash;I brought
upon him Ruin, Dishonour, Imprisonment and Death.  Dost
thou hear?"
</p>

<p>
The hermit returned mildly:
</p>

<p>
"Unhappy man, I hear thee.  Thine excuse must be, thou
hadst no thought of evil towards thy friend!"
</p>

<p>
"No thought, God He knows!  And whether my patron
suspected the truth, that I know not.  But to the very
last&mdash;he loved and trusted me!  And when he had suffered the
penalty of decapitation for his faith&mdash;torture being spared
him in consideration of great services rendered to the Empire,&mdash;I
stole his body secretly under cover of night.  In the crypt
of a deserted church it was reverently burned to ashes.  These
I placed in an urn&mdash;and swore an oath upon the urn in the
name of the God of Israel,&mdash;that I and my sons and my sons'
sons,&mdash;while there remains a living male of the blood of
Hazaël&mdash;will be Keeper of the Ashes and Guardians of their
Shrine!  And I from the Abode of Shadows, the Lord Most
High permitting!&mdash;will stretch forth mine hand upon those that
descend from me&mdash;and counsel them aright!  And when the
last male of the race hath served and passed,&mdash;the debt shall
be paid&mdash;and I cleansed of blood-guilt towards the man who
was my friend!"
</p>

<p>
"The prayer being made from a repentant heart, hath
reached the Throne of the Highest.  Is that all thou hast to
say, O Jew?"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël cried angrily to the anchorite through the wall-hole:
</p>

<p>
"Not so!  For I have taken this journey to bring thee a
message from my master, the noble Philoremus Fabius, late
Prætor of the Taxes of Egypt at Alexandria, who is now
amongst the Shades."
</p>

<p>
From the tangled ambush of his snow-white hair, fixing his
radiant eyes upon the fierce eyes glaring through the wall-hole,
the Athlete of Christ demanded:
</p>

<p>
"Was the man baptised a Christian?"
</p>

<p>
Hazaël answered roughly:
</p>

<p>
"Have I not said to thee but now,&mdash;that without having
formally embraced the Faith of the Crucified, or received the
waters of baptism,&mdash;Philoremus testified to Christianity, and
suffered the penalty.  Melittus, Abbot of Scete, Peter, the
Patriarch of Alexandria, the monks Philip, Ammon and Geta,
Theodore and Pæsius and others, underwent death by torture
on the same day.  In consideration of his great services to
Rome, Philoremus suffered only decapitation by the sword.
And I am commanded of him to entreat thee to pray that his
sins may be forgiven.  And that for him the Hand that was
pierced may open the Gate of Hope!  Dost thou
comprehend?  Hast thou heard distinctly?"
</p>

<p>
The head of the Saint inclined in assent.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;thou wilt pray as he desired?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, if thou consent to forgive the Copt who slew the Rab
thy father many years ago.  For I declare to thee by the light
that is vouchsafed me, that the blow from the beam was given
unwittingly; and those who told thee that the man mocked, lied.
And cease from saying and working evil against the Church
of Christ.  For dear to the Lord are His servants!"
</p>

<p>
And the Jew, struggling with himself, promised; and then
cried:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, O holy man! what is this Gate of Hope? ... Shall
my master be admitted? ... Or&mdash;hath he already entered
therein? ... I know that thou hast power to vanquish
devils, and canst see beyond the Three Veils that baffle human
vision.  Therefore, answer me, I pray!"
</p>

<p>
The aged hands stiffened in the attitude of supplication.
The eyes of the Saint looked upwards, seeming to pierce
through the roof of stone, from which great bats hung in
clusters, into Infinite Immensity.  Moments passed and Hazaël
waited.  But when an hour had gone by:
</p>

<p>
"Wilt thou not speak?" he cried angrily.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  Looking more narrowly he could not
observe that the breast of the rigid upright figure lifted or sank
with the natural act of respiration.  He found himself shuddering
with terror lest the anchorite should be dead.  The weight
of vast solitudes peopled only by eagles, bats and diabolical
phantoms descended upon him crushingly.  And in the voice
of a suppliant he entreated:
</p>

<p>
"In the name of the Most High, give me a sign that thou
livest!"
</p>

<p>
The hands fell apart.  The upturned eyes quivered.  A
long sigh heaved the wide emaciated chest, and the great
prominent ribs of the fleshless brown body, tenanted by the
fiery soul of the great Athlete of Christ.  Without otherwise
stirring he reached down, seized a small harp from its place
in the niche behind him, poised it upon his breast, swept the
strings with his fleshless hands; and chanted in the powerfully
melodious voice that had thundered upon the ears of the Jew
down the cataract of limestone:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Not through the wisdom of strange words:<br>

  And like the Jew Hazaël&mdash;<br>
  (Who, rejecting the Gospel of JESUS<br>
  Yet shall perish at the hands of idolaters<br>
  For the upholding of His Honour)<br>
  Even I,<br>
  Littlest among Christ's servants&mdash;<br>
  May enter in at the Gate of Hope<br>
  And drink of the new-pressed wine of Paradise!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The singer ceased as dawn whitened the eastern sky, and the
dome of Mount Derhor was reddened by the first rays of the
sun.  The harp, clutched in his rigid hands, still vibrated with
the last chords struck upon it.  But the Saint was once more
rapt in contemplation, from which neither appeals nor threats
could rouse him.  Boiling with indignation at what he had
heard, Hazaël shook the dust from his garments, and set off
with rapid strides down the crevassed limestone slope.
</p>

<p>
He returned by the path round the shoulder of the precipice,
and through the narrow cleft into the pass where he had
suffered temptation of the demon; found some water yet
remaining in the cave's tiny hollow, and, eating his last dates
as he went, emerged at length from the porphyry ravine upon
the desert plain upon whose burning soil he had discovered the
charger of gold, saying to himself:
</p>

<p>
"I will hurry forward to the oasis of the spring,&mdash;fasten the
camel to a tree there, and bring the Saracen back to assist
me.  It cannot be meant that so much treasure should be
abandoned to serve no useful end!  It should realise when sold, at
least ten thousand talents.  Half of this money belongs to
the Athlete, seeing that his dwelling is in the mountain.  With
the rest I shall enrich myself, and return with my household
to Palestine!"
</p>

<p>
But when he arrived once more in sight of the spot where
he had found the treasure, he found there, gathered about it,
a horde of savage Blemmyes from the Red Sea wilderness,
who periodically penetrated the fastnesses of Derhor by some
of the eastern defiles.  Enraged at seeing these naked, painted
heathens hoisting the mass of gold upon their shoulders, amidst
shrill ululations of joy from the fierce, hawk-eyed women who
accompanied them, the Jew swung his great staff high,
shouting:
</p>

<p>
"Restore the spoil that another found before you, ye
abominable ones!" and charged the Blemmyes, scattering them
with tremendous blows.
</p>

<p>
But the savage idolaters only dispersed like jackals or vultures
scared from a carcass, to gather again at a distance; and
from thence discharged stones from their slings so skilfully
that Hazaël was wounded and beaten to the ground.  Then
overpowering him, the barbarians strongly bound his wrists
and ankles, and drawing them apart, secured each limb to a
stake, driven deep into the soil.
</p>

<p>
Then, concluding that all men returning from the Inner
Mountain must needs be Christian pilgrims, the chief of the
band set his foot upon the breast of the Israelite and&mdash;speaking
in bastard Greek&mdash;and brandishing his spear with menacing
gestures&mdash;commanded him forthwith to blaspheme Christ,
and abjure the Faith&mdash;or die amidst tortures unspeakable.
</p>

<p>
Upon which Hazaël shouted furiously:
</p>

<p>
"You ignorant rabble!  I am a devout Jew, and will never
accept the Nazarite Prophet as Messiah! and I have even
brought persecution upon those who worship Him!
Nevertheless, for love of Him my master Philoremus Fabius
suffered death at Alexandria, and in His name the Saint of
Derhor performs marvellous works.  And I have sworn before
the God of my fathers henceforth to abstain from speaking
or doing evil against Christ's servants: yet I am not a
Christian, and never will be!"
</p>

<p>
But the Blemmyes clustered about him like bees, stinging
and pricking him with their sharp spear-points, and the savage
women, reaching between the legs of the men, prodded him
with thorns and tore his flesh with sharpened stones, so that
there was not a whole patch upon his body, that was all gory
red from head to foot.  And they jabbered at him to blaspheme,
urging incessantly:
</p>

<p>
"Execrate Christ and thou art free!"
</p>

<p>
He whom they tortured shouting lustily:
</p>

<p>
"Ye vultures of the Desert, I will not!"
</p>

<p>
Then, failing to work their will, they made upon his body a
fire of dried camel's dung, and took the gold and went away.
</p>

<p>
While to the tortured Jew, dying amidst horrible agonies,
it seemed that he saw his master Philoremus, joyful and
smiling, standing near a Young Man apparelled in white, and of
sublime and radiant visage, who extended towards the sufferer
His beautiful wounded Hands....  And amidst a great Light
and many voices, One Voice spoke, saying words inconceivably
wonderful....  And the bands of mortality were peeled
from Hazaël's vision, and his spirit passed beyond the Veil
of the Unknown.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In the same hour the Abbot Pachomius at Tabenna, being
in prayer at the conclusion of the morning Sacrifice, received
a revelation and cried out:
</p>

<p>
"Lord! do Thou multiply Thy mercies upon the Jew Hazaël
Hazaël, who rejecting the Gospel of the New Testament, hath
yet died for Thee!"
</p>

<p>
And sending a messenger to the quayside where the faithful
Ephraim waited aboard the vessel with the Coptish sailors,
the Abbot warned the servant of Hazaël that evil had come to
him....  Then Ephraim went forth into the desert with a
strong party of armed Saracens on swift camels, and traversing
the Valley of the Chariots, and climbing the pass north of
the oasis of the spring, reached the place where the Blemmyes
had put the Jew to death.  The head, limbs and extremities,
though scorched and shrivelled, remained unconsumed.  The
charred trunk had burst asunder, and within the hoops of the
great blackened ribs, the indomitable heart of the just steward
lay amidst grey ashes; all red, like a newly-quenched coal.
Upon one of the dried-up hands hung a tarnished signet-ring
that the Blemmyes had not noticed,&mdash;or had feared to meddle
with, lest it might be a talisman.
</p>

<p>
It was the signet with the black onyx, given by the Roman
Philoremus Fabius to Hazaël....  And Ephraim, taking the
ring from the dead hand, scraped a shallow grave in the
hot sandy gravel; buried the remains, and made above the
spot a great pile of stones.
</p>

<p>
Then he journeyed back to Alexandria, carrying the news
and the ring, and goods of Hazaël; and Miriam and little
Leah wept sorely; and the boy Levi said Kaddish for the dead.

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
John Benn Hazel lived with his mother, and Maurice,
his younger brother, at Campden Hill Terrace.  Mrs. Hazel
was a widow of long standing; well-to-do, well-preserved,
well-powdered, dyed and corseted, and experienced in
the ways of the world.  Formerly, as she admitted, "a frightful
flirt," she was still prone to recurrent attacks of the milder
kind of friskiness.  Of her two sons, she was chiefly mother
to the more gifted Maurice&mdash;an illustrator of books of the
exotic, precious, subtle type&mdash;and periodicals of the same pale
cerulean hue.  Before the War Maurice possessed a Marcelle
wave and a Beardsley Line&mdash;both attained by infinite perseverance.
Later he acquired the certificate of a Pilot-Aviator, and
flew a Handley-Page bomber on the Western Front.
</p>

<p>
Mother and sons agreed marvellously, unless when one of
Mrs. Hazel's elderly adorers, persons of ripe years and
desirable financial solidity, endeavoured to persuade her to
forsake her widowed state.  The most favoured of these was a
certain Mr. Herman Van Ost, London partner and representative
of a thriving and long-established firm of Dutch
bulb-merchants.  As a stepfather John Hazel would have regarded
the Dutchman with more or less placidity.  But Maurice found
the idea intolerable, and thus the bulb of Van Ost's hopes
remained in the shop window; showing a pale green spike at
intervals, in earnest of latent possibilities in the flowering
line,&mdash;but never achieving more.
</p>

<p>
All three Hazels were members of the same mixed Club,&mdash;(who
does not know "The Tubs" in Werkeley Street, W.)&mdash;and
firmly believed the Parish of St. James's the hub of the
civilised world.  All three were ardent votaries of Bridge; all
yearned to be admitted into the inner circles of Society, but
were content to grasp at the outer fringe.  All three adored
Russian Ballet, Musical Comedy, Film Plays and up-to-date
Revues.  Each revelled in the Tango and thought no fashion
in modes, colours, coiffures, furniture, manners and morals,
so quite too frightfully fetching as the last.  They were of
sport, sporting; but their talk turned chiefly upon things of the
theatre theatrical; and they always knew to a thousand how
much the last Big Production had cost the Syndicate running
such-and-such a West End house.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes they disagreed as to the exact weight of the
gloves worn by the French pugilistic champion, and So-and-so,
the hope of England&mdash;in their classical contest at the Punching
Club; or as to the precise source whence Didi Debée obtained
her celebrated strings of pearls, or grew warm over the rival
merits of famous exponents of the Tango; or contradicted one
another touching the precise terms in which Betty Ballorme
had notified the Duke of Blankshire that a less economical
nobleman would be more welcome in her flat.  But if they
quarrelled they made friends again over some more recent
item of gossip.  Jimmy Greggson had got a new gag, or a
fresh wheeze in the Second Act of "The Filberts" at Riley's
Theatre, just before the famous 'Dance of The Varalette.'  Or
a new supper-dish or a fresh dance-step would have
appeared upon the menu of some eclectic restaurant cum-night-club,
run by managers who catered for every variety of taste.
</p>

<p>
It will be seen that the sons of Mrs. Hazel were happy in
their parent, whose business gift was not to be despised.  In
partnership with a peeress of somewhat clouded reputation
she ran a millinery and flower-shop at a double frontage in
Dove Street, Piccadilly: adding to her annual life-interest on
her late husband's not inconsiderable fortune, a really
handsome sum.
</p>

<p>
Probably her elder son inherited Mrs. Hazel's business aptitude
though such a legacy is more usually held to be derived
from the paternal side.  The product of one of the lesser
public schools (Loamborough may be quoted) and graduate of
Brazingham University, he decided that it was possible to do
Big Things without a string of piffling letters tacked on to
your name.  So, the City of London happening to beckon
at that juncture, he leaped gladly to her grimy embrace, and
his thirty-second birthday, occurring on the third of July,
1914, found him formally received and accredited as Junior
Partner in the thriving firm of Dannahill, Lee-Levyson and
Hazel, insurance-brokers of Cornhill.  He was engaged to
Beryl Lee-Levyson.  He looked forward&mdash;under the summer
sky fast blackening with fearful presages of tempest&mdash;not
exactly with rapture, but with content&mdash;to their approaching
marriage; a house in Eaton Terrace, S.W.,&mdash;Eaton Square
being the address of the Lee-Levysons&mdash;having been inspected
and approved, a week before the gates of Terror opened and
the world grew pale with dread.  In that first fierce spate of
blood the elder son of Lee-Levyson, a promising young
lieutenant in a crack Hussar regiment, was overwhelmed and
swept away.  The favourite grandson of Dannahill, Head of
the Firm, a Sergeant in a London Territorial Regiment,
later rendered distinguished service, and died gloriously on
the thirteenth day of the First Battle of the Aisne.  That
September evening John Hazel got home to Campden Hill
unusually late for dinner, bringing with him a clumsy parcel
which contained:
</p>

<p>
<i>Item</i>: one coat highly polished at the elbows, kept for
office night-work.
</p>

<p>
<i>Item</i>: a silver inkstand, a birthday present, inscribed: "<i>From
S. and M.H.</i>" (Sara and Maurice Hazel) "<i>to J.B.H., July
6th, 1914.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Item: a tinted photograph of Beryl Lee-Levyson, a tall,
willowy young woman in narrow diaphanous garments, with
tightly-banded hair of pale gold, a bluish-pink complexion, a
straight nose with a ripple in the bridge, large and well-opened
light grey eyes, and the kind of smile that advertises an
excellent set of teeth.  It bore the inscription:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "<i>From Girlie, with Love to Her Best Boy.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A box of cigars, a silver cigarette box, some well-browned
meerschaum holders, and a burned briar-root pipe, completed
the inventory of the property contained in the shapeless parcel
which John Hazel lugged up to his room, and dumped upon
his bed.
</p>

<p>
"What are these things?" asked his mother, coming in to
tell John not to wait to dress, as she and Maury were going
to look in at Riley's to see the 'Dance of the Varalette' once
again before Jimmy Greggson went to the Front....
</p>

<p>
"Of course; good old Jimmy's a London Terrier! ... Did
you ask about those? ..." said John, who stood at the
looking-glass in shirt-sleeves, brushing his coarse strong curly
hair with two big ivory-backed brushes, and meeting the
maternal eyes in the mirror with something not unlike a scowl.
All the principles instilled at Loamborough, by dint of many
poundings, forbade him to embrace his mother and weep; yet
strange wild impulses urged him to commit this sin against the
Code of Correct British behaviour.  He went on, looking at her
in the glass, deepening his scowl and speaking gruffly: "They'd
be frightfully in the way at the office....  I rather thought
you'd look after them until I get back from the Front!"
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's pregnant silence in the room, while
Mrs. Hazel with a wildly thumping heart, was realising how
awfully she had dreaded that it would be Maurice who would
have to go! ... Then she rustled over to John's side, reached
up on tiptoe, though she was a tall woman, and giving him
two little pecking kisses on the angle of his blue-shaven brown
jaw, murmured something about getting up some champagne
to-night to make up for the tinned <i>entrées</i> at dinner, and
rustled out of the room&mdash;John knew&mdash;to tell the news downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"What?  Old J. going? ... Good for him!" was Maurice's
languidly-approving comment on the intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Nobody grumbled, though John did delay to change, and
came down arrayed in the gladdest rags his well-supplied
wardrobe boasted, to tell his mother and Maurice of Sam
Dannahill's glorious death.  Such a frightful knock for the
Firm, coming on the heels of the bad news about Beauchamp
Lee-Levyson!&mdash;and how the Boss had taken the grim wire
from the War Office "like a regular First Class Old Brick."
</p>

<p>
Ah, if in that bad quarter of an hour succeeding the opening
of the telegram John could have looked through the fortunately
opaque glass of the door with "Senior Partner" painted
on it,&mdash;he would have seen no dignified white-haired City
Insurance-broker, telling with a dry eye but a trembling lip
how bravely Sam had died! but a frantic old grandsire,
tearing his hair and beard, and crying even as David in the high
gate-chamber: "My child!&mdash;my hope and comfort!  O if it
had been granted that I might die for thee, my boy, my
beloved one!"
</p>

<p>
Pray observe John Benn Hazel, standing on the Daghestani
hearthrug, with his back to the fern-filled fireplace in the
Briton's customary style.
</p>

<p>
You saw him as a broad-shouldered, lean-flanked, deep-chested
young man of thirty-two, six feet three in his stockings
and proportionately powerful.  His huge frame of bone,
knit with solid muscle, was sparingly padded with tough hard
flesh, covered with dull, dry brown skin that looked as though
it needed to be soaked in blazing sunshine to become sleek and
soft.  Coarse, wiry, curly hair, densely black as the broad
beetling brows and the deep-set eyes under them, closely
capped his high dome-topped skull, and grew low upon his
forehead,&mdash;tinged with blue where it was most closely clipped
on the temples and about the ears,&mdash;and at the nape of the
long thick neck, that needed the razor's frequent application
even as the strong jaws, the long, deeply-channelled upper-lip,
and the chin, quite abnormally long, with a dent in its
squared end.  His was a huge salient nose, thick and boldly
curved, with mobile nostrils; and a large, rather loose-lipped
mouth, purplish-red and frankly sensual, with a quirk of
humour at the deeply-cut corners, and displaying a formidable
array of big white teeth when he laughed.  His large, well-shaped
ears did not lie sufficiently close to his head for beauty,
and the prominent Adam's apple of his muscular brown throat
was the despair of City collar-makers; while no glove that
hosier ever supplied could be got to button over his great
wrist,&mdash;the joint of the ulna, Maurice bragged,&mdash;being as big
as a pony's pastern.  His feet were huge and clumsy as his
hands, a fact too well known of Mrs. Hazel's Pomeranian.
His excellent opinion of himself was much evident when he
talked in his loud, deep, booming voice, or laughed at jokes
of his own manufacture, which appealed to him more than
others.  When his sense of humour was really touched, his
guffaw was an outrage on the nerves of other people, and
fragile articles within reach of his lengthy arms were wont
to be swept from shelves or stands.  But Maurice was not
driven to put his fingers in his ears, on this particular
evening; nor was Mrs. Hazel to glance even once in apprehension
at her Dresden china shepherdesses simpering on the mantel-shelf.
</p>

<p>
She came into John's room again that night, long after they
had parted, with an excuse about being anxious to make sure,&mdash;in
case he should not yet have switched off the electric
lights,&mdash;that his blinds were closely drawn down behind the open
windows, and the new curtains of green casement-cloth properly
closed.  The police had warned householders all along
the Terrace.  Not in the least deceived, John sat up in bed,
looming bigly in a blatant suit of pink-striped silk pyjamas,
conscious that upon his pillow was a big wet patch of which
a Briton's hardy eyes ought to have been ashamed.  The
mother looked absurdly young, it seemed to her son,&mdash;with her
still abundant auburn hair, as yet only lightly crisped with
grey,&mdash;hanging in a thick loose plait down the back of her
pale blue <i>crêpe</i> dressing-gown, as she retreated from the
window,&mdash;to examine the War-arrangements of which she had
had to switch on the light:&mdash;pecked him again&mdash;upon his
forehead this time&mdash;and said with elaborate casualness:
</p>

<p>
"You told us&mdash;among other amusing things&mdash;to-night at
supper"&mdash;John was pleased to find that he had been amusing&mdash;"about
the papers you had had to fill at the Army Recruiting
place." ...
</p>

<p>
"Saying how old I am, and where I was born,&mdash;and what
my father's nationality was&mdash;and what my religion is," John
told her with a cheerful grin: adding as she lingered,
apparently in expectation: "But the really funny things&mdash;regular
howlers!&mdash;were on the spoiled papers lying about."  His big
body shook with a chuckle that was not genuine.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind the funny things just now!  How did you
answer that question about your father? ... What nationality
did you say his was?"  Her blue-grey eyes, still brilliant
and effective, sparkled feverishly under knitted eyebrows.
Her voice was sharp and strained, in the ears of her son.
He answered with a dull flush darkening his heavy features:
</p>

<p>
"I said he was British.  Isn't that good enough?" He
added as he hugged his great bony knees, and stared over their
barrier at the worried face of his mother: "You don't
suppose I'd be ass enough to make a false declaration, even
though the Pater's governor happens to be a Palestine Jew!
Is the old chap still alive, by the way?  If so, he must be
getting on for a hundred!"
</p>

<p>
"He was sixty-nine when I saw him at Malta thirty years
ago, and taller and broader than any of his sons&mdash;as upright
as a column.  You've a look of him&mdash;there are times when I
see it!&mdash;but you take after your father more! ..."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate my father was naturalised an Englishman,
and Hazel sounds English enough," said John.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;oh, yes!"
</p>

<p>
As she drummed on the foot-rail of the bedstead, imparting
a rather unpleasant vibration to the tautened nerves of her
elder son, John coughed a deep hollow cough to cover his
embarrassment, and said gruffly;
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with your telling me about my father
and his people?  I've never asked before, but I think I'd
better know!"
</p>

<p>
"His first name was John, like yours, but the name is really
Hazaël.  The Hazaëls were wealthy merchants, exporters of
produce from the Mediterranean Coast&mdash;and wines&mdash;chiefly
from vineyards of their own."
</p>

<p>
"That stuff I've seen advertised&mdash;Palestine Port, Tokay
and Muscatel,&mdash;sound and nourishing, twenty-five years old?"
</p>

<p>
"It's very good&mdash;and your father has often told me that
even before the Colonies were founded in 1827,&mdash;when I've
heard there were only ten Jews at Jaffa&mdash;his father's father's
great grandfather was a vine-grower and exporter of wine.
The business originally started in Egypt&mdash;they have a business
house to-day at Alexandria&mdash;and another at Jaffa and a
branch at Malta&mdash;where your father and I first met."
</p>

<p>
"Stop! ... What about you?"
</p>

<p>
"Me....  Oh&mdash;well!  I was sixteen, and frightfully romantic,
and supposed to be going in for what people called 'a
decline.' ... Anæmia would be the proper name for it in
these days: and Hull, where your grandfather had his place of
business, was cold and gloomy; and Malta was supposed to be
the cure....  I loved Malta!  What girl wouldn't?  All
sunshine and flowery gardens, and violet sea, and turquoise
skies.  And all the fruit and' flowers one wanted&mdash;and a
handsome man to squire one about!  For your father was quite
charming.  He spoke beautiful English, and French like a
native; he had been educated at Paris, they said, and when
my father told me of John's intentions, I was ready to jump
over the moon!"
</p>

<p>
She broke off, and John roused himself to say:
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, if the Pater was a Syrian Jew, your governor
was British enough! ... Of course I never saw him, as the
old man was dead and buried before we went to live with my
grandmother.  But Symons does sound like a good old
English name!"
</p>

<p>
"That's why your grandmother persuaded your grandfather
to adopt it.  His real name was Simonoff, and she never
liked it!  She was a Yorkshire Isaacson!"
</p>

<p>
There was a pregnant silence before John asked in
muffled accents:
</p>

<p>
"Was my grandfather on your side a Russian?" and was
clubbed by the reply:
</p>

<p>
"He was a Russian Jew from Moscow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come!  Don't rub it in!"  The bedstead creaked
protestingly.
</p>

<p>
"Dearie, you must have guessed!  You've always known
that he did business in hides and tallow and tar, between
Hamburg and Hull."
</p>

<p>
"I remember Hull when I was a kid, and the warehouse,
and Old Mendel, who used to bring me peppermint-rock
when he came to see my grandmother.  He managed the
business for her, didn't he, until my Uncle Ben took it
over?  But&mdash;my grandfather a Russian Jew!  Let's bless our
stars he wasn't a German!  Where were you married to my
father?"
</p>

<p>
"In a Maltese Synagogue.  We lived at Malta until your
father brought us to England, to establish a business-branch
at Southampton.  And we had hardly been settled there a
year&mdash;you were only three when John died....
Pneumonia&mdash;this climate never really suited him!  And I went
home to mother with you and Maury, a baby of six months
old.  There was no bother about money.  You know your
father left us comfortably off!"
</p>

<p>
John cleared his throat and nodded.  The bitterness of the
last pill Fate had administered puckered his palate yet.
Between the Jew of Palestine and the Jew of Russia, he had
been wrought all Jewish.  Not a single globule of British
blood mingled with the Oriental tide that galloped through
his veins.  He asked, not wanting to know particularly:
</p>

<p>
"Did my father's people drop you, after he died, or was it
you who decided to drop them?"
</p>

<p>
His mother returned with a sprightlier air&mdash;she was now
sitting on the bedside.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!&mdash;well!&mdash;it was like this.  While John was alive, his
father, old Mr. Hazaël, sent me kind messages very often
in his letters,&mdash;always written to John in Hebrew, by Amos
the eldest son.  For John came third in the family.  Amos
and Isaac had been years married and had heaps of children
before John met with me.  And after John died and we went
to live at Hull, the letters kept on coming.  It was my father's
head-clerk who always translated them&mdash;Old Mendel was a
learned man!&mdash;and wrote back the answers I dictated.  Then
my father died&mdash;poor father!&mdash;he never could forgive me for
being only a daughter!&mdash;and Cousin Ben took the business
over&mdash;and mother and I, with you and Maury&mdash;came here to
London to live.  Do you think I did wrong in dropping the
correspondence?  You know how your father's fortune was
settled on you two children, with a life-interest for me; we
need not go into that!  There was nothing more to come to
us&mdash;under any circumstances!  And I wanted my two boys
to be brought up as English gentlemen, and I don't think
I've done quite so badly&mdash;do you?"
</p>

<p>
Her tone was almost pleading.  John reached out a lengthy
arm and hugged his mother warmly:
</p>

<p>
"Not by half, Old Thing!  On the contrary.  You thought
it would be best for me and Maury to be British, and you
rubbed it into us that we were, from the time we began
to talk....  I remember at Loamborough, a Fifth Form fellow
said to me over some rotten boggle of mine at Sunday Ques:
'With that bally big nose of yours, Hazel major, you ought
to know all about the Children of Israel&mdash;'  And, by George!
I welted the beggar until he apologised.  Later on, when I knew
more about the Pater, I told myself that the English strain
came from the mother's side.  Now you've exploded that idea;
I don't know that I mind much! ... Lots of people we're
friendly with are as much Hebrews as ourselves,&mdash;and taking
us in the lump, I call us a loyal lot!"  He dug his long chin
into the bedclothes covering the big knees he hugged; and
went on speaking: "And Jewish blood is strong red stuff
to have in one's veins, mind you!  Great lawyers, great financiers,
great actors, singers, painters, writers&mdash;people who are
things and do things!&mdash;people who count&mdash;how many of them
have got it!&mdash;in bulk or else diluted.  And some of the
prettiest women&mdash;and girls&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're thinking of Beryl!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I was thinking of Beryl...&mdash;Lee Levyson may belong
to a Yorkshire family.  He says so, and I've no wish to
contradict him.  And Dannahill blows a frightful lot about his
good old English ancestors.  But all the same&mdash;"  He broke
off to smile at his mother, who,&mdash;not as a rule demonstrative
towards her elder son,&mdash;was stroking his big wrist, and
half-absently trying to span it with the inadequate measure of her
thumb and middle-finger; and ended: "You can take it from
me that there ain't a single member of the Firm who oughtn't&mdash;if
the truth were worth telling&mdash;to have a capital 'J' on
his disc."
</p>

<p>
"His disc?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I was speaking metaphorically.  I mean the round tin
identification-tag that's sewn inside of Tommy's khaki jacket,
and worn on a chain soldered round his wrist when he's
going to the Front.  Mine'll be 'Private J.B. Hazel, No. 000,
X Platoon, F. Company, 4th Battalion, 448th City of London
(Fenchurch Street) Royal Fusiliers.'"
</p>

<p>
"Do they put all that?"
</p>

<p>
"I rather think so, with letters for your religious denomination.
Con. for Congregationalist, Wes. for Wesleyan, Meth. for
Methodist, Bap. for Baptist, P.B. for Plymouth Brethren,
C.S. for Christian Scientist, Mug. for Muggletonian, C.E.,
Church of England, R.C., Roman Catholic; J. for Jew, and
<i>Nil</i> if you aren't of any religion.  And I'd put down '<i>Nil</i>'
for mine!"
</p>

<p>
"What made you do that?  Why not Church of England?"
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not Church of anything, any more than you and
Maurice or the Lee-Levysons&mdash;or anybody!&mdash;belonging to the
set of people we visit and meet and dine....  Nice, pleasant,
sociable heathens&mdash;that's what we are, every one of us!  We
have plum-pudding at Christmas; and salt-fish with egg-and-oyster
sauce on Good Fridays; and we drop in at Westminster
Abbey to hear the Carols; and at Westminster Cathedral or
Farm Street for the Passion Music;&mdash;or the Greek Church
near the Russian Embassy, because the singing is worth
hearing,&mdash;and other people go!  And we scrum into St. Paul's for
a Public Thanksgiving&mdash;or a Day of Humiliation, or a big
Funeral or any other kind of Function....  And St. George's
Hanover Square for Society weddings,&mdash;or the Brompton
Oratory....  But religion....  Have any of us got it? ... 'You
can search me!' as the American fellow says in the
revue....  Still, if you'd like me to alter the letters on my
disc I don't mind doing it.  Only&mdash;instead of '<i>Nil</i>' there'll be
a big 'J' for Jew!"
</p>

<p>
She waxed shrill, driven beyond herself, used words long
forgotten:
</p>

<p>
"But you're not one.  You've never even set foot inside a
Synagogue.  We don't observe the Shabbos&mdash;I mean the
Sunday!&mdash;we eat <i>triphah</i> meat like Gentiles.  We're
<i>Meshumad</i>&mdash;apostates, don't you understand?  Orthodox Jews wouldn't
even speak to us!&mdash;aren't we well enough as we are?"
</p>

<p>
"Would my grandfathers have thought so?  Or my
father?" ...
</p>

<p>
She caught her breath and clutched at her bosom, the deep,
slow voice was so unlike the younger John's.  Unobservant
of the consternation in her face, he went on speaking,
gradually recovering the manner and tone most usual with him:
</p>

<p>
"Alive, they'd have disowned us.  Not being alive&mdash;what
we observe or don't observe, can't affect them!  The notion
of a dead man stretching out a hand from the grave, and
grabbing hold of his son by the scruff to drive the unlucky
beggar on in the ancient ruts of his own prehistoric prejudices
is exploded.  For the dead are DEAD.  There's no getting over
that!  And to let their thoughts, feelings, desires, convictions,
influence us in Anything is to my mind, sheer sentimental
piffle."  John blew himself out importantly and waved away
the subject, but came back, having something more to say:
"I'm an ambitious chap in my way....  I'd like to make
enough money on the Stock Exchange to buy the freehold
of Covent Garden; and turn the Market,&mdash;the Arcades,&mdash;the
shops and the Opera House into a Pleasure City,&mdash;run on
American lines.  But I've no ambition to live after I'm
dead,&mdash;that I know of! ... If I get wiped out at the Front it
won't make any difference to me whether they stick a cross
over me&mdash;or a shield with some Hebrew letters painted on
a white deal board....  Beryl can get married the day after
if she wants to! ... <i>I</i> shan't ever know she's being kissed
by another man.  Nor shall I be one jot worse or better off
because of the Good or Bad marks set against me.  It matters
how you live your life, because Morality is necessary&mdash;to
preserve Health and maintain Decency, and so uphold the Law.
But when one dies one's done with!&mdash;and the wisest rule of
existence is, to live as long as possible, and enjoy things while
one can!  To succeed, to become famous, that's the only
immortality&mdash;and to leave a son to carry on your name is a
way of cheating Death!"  He ended this confession of his
creed by saying rather wistfully: "I meant to ask you....
Do you&mdash;do you think there's any chance of Beryl's marrying
me before I go?"
</p>

<p>
"To the Front! ... Why shouldn't there be?  Why not
ask her?" ...
</p>

<p>
"Thanks awfully for the tip.  I will!"
</p>

<p>
He was cheered by her absolute belief that he could not
but prevail.  For if she had forgotten her faith, and turned
her back upon her people; she was a mother and a loving
one.  There was motherhood in her face and in her voice
as she asked John:
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you even told Beryl&mdash;what you&mdash;where you're
going, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"No! so if she's got a white feather keeping up her sleeve
for me, she'll be disappointed, that's all!  My hat!&mdash;listen
to that clock striking!  Do you understand it's gone two!
You won't have any beauty-sleep,&mdash;and I've got to be at
Regimental Headquarters at ten sharp to-morrow, to get my kit
with the rest of the Fourth Battalion, and weigh in at Eaton
Square at 11.30 to break the great news and show myself
to the girl."
</p>

<p>
But when Mrs. Hazel had finally departed, John got out of
bed, switched on a light and searched on the shelf that
contained his private library, for a fat one-volume Encyclopædia
that had been a School Prize.  After some delving in this mine
of knowledge, he emerged the wiser by the information
appended:
</p>

<p>
"JEWS, an Asiatic race (Semitic), descended from the
Hebrew Patriarch Abraham.  Original stock migrated 2,000
B.C. from Ur in Chaldea, an important centre of civilisation, to
the land of Canaan (Phœnicia) and from thence in time
of scarcity to the rich pasture-lands of Egypt; from whence
tradition has it that their leader and lawgiver, Moses, was
divinely inspired to lead them, by way of the Red Sea Gulf
and the Sinaitic Wilderness.  Through his teachings they
renounced polytheism and adopted a monotheistic form of
worship.  Language, Hebrew, a variant of the Canaanitish branch
of the Semitic Group, approximating closely to Phœnician or
Moabite."
</p>

<p>
The richer by this gem, John put back the book, switched
off the light and got back into bed.
</p>

<p>
Sleep delayed in coming.  As he stared wide-eyed into the
darkness, fragmentary recollections of that long-dead father
formed fresh pictures in his brain.  He saw a room, with a
table laid for dinner with white napery and glittering silver, the
high child's chair by which he stood, a chubby boy in petticoats,
waiting for strong, gentle arms to lift him to the seat.
While the owner of the arms, a tall man, dark and grave,
washed his hands at a shining metal laver hanging on the
dining-room wall beside the door.  The tall man wore his hat
during this ceremony, and the towel he used was long and
narrow, and had embroidered ends....
</p>

<p>
A similar laver had hung on the wall in his grandmother's
private sitting-room, John remembered; carefully dusted, but
never used by anybody as far as he had known.  And over the
laver had hung a plaque of metal, embossed with Hebrew
characters: such a <i>mezusah</i> as one saw affixed to doorposts in
the City: thickening as one got nearer to Houndsditch: becoming
dense in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel Road and the
Commercial Road, E....
</p>

<p>
He was destined to enjoy no beauty-sleep that night.
</p>

<p>
For this materialistic, hard-headed, commonplace young
City insurance-broker was loyal of nature, capable of warm
attachments; faithful in friendship and honourable; according
to his somewhat narrow Code.  And the country in which he
had been reared, the home in which Life had unfolded for his
infant consciousness, the associations amongst which he had
developed from a gawky boy into a tall young man, were
English: and he had not known previously how much that meant
to him.
</p>

<p>
England was John Hazel's England, the City of London his
by choice and adoption; the Tom Tiddler's Ground where he, a
citizen and a patriot, had meant to pick up as much of the good
stuff Money as he possibly could get.  He loved Great Britain,
her history, traditions, rulers and institutions with a love blind,
instinctive, and deeply rooted, that embraced her Colonies and
the Dominions Beyond the Seas.  He had never lumbered up
on his huge feet to do honour to the National Anthem; or
cheered the King and Queen and the Prince of Wales, and
other notabilities passing in procession to the Guildhall or
elsewhere,&mdash;or listened to a patriotic speech at a City dinner,&mdash;or
a West End public charity-function, without a big lump rising
in his throat.
</p>

<p>
And since the blizzard of War had burst upon this, his
mother-country, and the new, strange, dreadful life had
replaced the pleasant, easy-going old one, his love for England
had become a rage.  The tramp of martial boots going through
the darkened streets; the heavy roll of guns, ammunition and
baggage-lorries; the columns of bronzed faces under khaki
cap-peaks, streaming under arches of railway stations; the
dreadful news bruited by the newspapers, shouted in the
streets, clubbing you when you opened your Latest Edition;&mdash;the
mourning weeds on the backs of strangers and friends; the
darkness of streets and restaurants and public places; the
thickly-curtained windows of one's own home and one's
neighbours' houses; the Spy Scare&mdash;and the hovering, haunting
menace of Invasion by Aircraft&mdash;increased his patriotic fever
day by day.  Great tears had splashed upon the dirty drab
paper he had signed when he enlisted.  And they were the
tears of an Asiatic;&mdash;a Semite whose ancestors had come out
of Ur in Chaldea&mdash;and whose native language was a variant of
the Canaanitish thingumbob.  Perhaps no genuine Englishman
would have shed them.  And yet, some pathetic parting-scenes
at Railway Stations had removed John's previous impression
that hefty, hardy, masculine Britons are never known
to cry.
</p>

<p>
One is sorrowful to remember that beyond the narrow range
of this young man's prejudices, and the stultifying influences
of his environment, extended boundless vistas of which a more
liberal and comprehensive range of reading;&mdash;fuel for the
engines of the winged chariot of Thought and Imagination&mdash;might
have made John Hazel free....
</p>

<p>
But he lay prone, dull and unimaginative; staring over the
bedclothes at the pale watery gleam of the dressing-mirror
opposite, while out of the mighty Past&mdash;reverberating and
flashing to this hour with the thunders and lightnings of
Sinai,&mdash;Patriarchs, Law-giver, Judges, Prophets and Sages, Poets,
Kings, Statesmen, Patriots, Preachers, Warriors, Artificers and
Craftsmen of vanished Israel and living Judæa&mdash;dominated by
One Figure, unspeakably more benign and glorious&mdash;looked
down in solemn pitying wonder on the young City insurance-broker,
who was depressed by the sudden discovery, that not
only on the father's side but on the mother's,&mdash;he had been
born a Jew.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Old J.B.H.!" he told himself encouragingly.
"Even if your ancestors did come out of Egypt with Moses,
you're a pup of the Big Bull Bitch.  And I'll tell you what,
my boy!  Good old England may count herself thundering
lucky, if she gets a few hundred thousand others of the same
breed to fight for her in this War!"

<p>
Panoplied for battle, in shoddy&mdash;misnamed khaki&mdash;of a
deadly stale-mustard hue, bound with braid of whitey-yellow,
garnished with the customary brass badges, buttons and
buckles, and completed with the brown leather belt, bayonet-sling
and bandolier; Private John Hazel&mdash;with a wire stiffener
in the crown of his cap, and his pampered flesh wincing from
the contact of the single Army rasper supplied him (for which,
in the first flush of patriotism he had discarded his customary
underwear)&mdash;presented himself before Beryl, his betrothed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, come now, Bur'l!" expostulated Muriel, Beryl's
younger sister, compassionate of John's immense discomfiture,
as Beryl subsided on the Rossmore couch in tears; and her
unlucky lover, standing huge and awkward in the middle of
the Wilton carpet, opposing his own full-length reflection in
a wall-mirror, realised that the collar of his tunic was
strangling, that his hands were bigger than he could have believed
them; and that the boots supplied by a grateful country would
have comfortably fitted a Brontosaur.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him," moaned Beryl, "to leave me to my misery!"
</p>

<p>
"She never used to mind poor Beechy in kharks," the
chagrined lover somewhat heatedly protested, on being
banished from the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"Beauchamp was so handsome," said Beryl's sister Muriel,
with her dancing dark eyes suddenly softening in tears, "and
then you know,&mdash;he was an Officer of Regular Cavalry&mdash;and
you're only a Common Tommy.  Of course at the bottom of
her heart Bur'l loves and respects you&mdash;but that's what's the
matter, John, old thing!  Wangle a Commission as soon as you
can manage it"&mdash;the term "wangle" was coming into use just
then&mdash;"do something Frightfully Distinguished&mdash;and she'll be
as right as rain with you, really she will!"
</p>

<p>
"Think so? ..." said John, with obviously artificial
lightness.  "Well, say good-bye to her for me for now, will you!
And&mdash;my crowd were guarding the line of the South Western
until a day or so back&mdash;and if I'd screwed myself up to the
point of joining up before,&mdash;I might have wangled a
D.C.M. by dropping on a German in the act of laying a time-fuse
bomb in a tunnel.  Now they've sent 'em out to Malta to train,
and yours truly and a band of other Brave Hearts&mdash;late
washouts!&mdash;are being sent after 'em!  So by-by, little girlie&mdash;for
I've got to buy a Cardigan jacket and a few other things I
want.  You might tell me Beryl's full Christian name&mdash;it's
got to go down in my Will, naturally!&mdash;and be entered for
reference with the Nearest of Kin, at the War Office&mdash;so that
they can let the old thing know if I get wiped out!"
</p>

<p>
John felt in a baggy front-pocket for a pigskin note-book, a
parting gift from Maurice, and produced it, with a
gold-mounted fountain-pen.  Muriel dimpled again roguishly, and
said with her bright eyes daringly challenging his own:
</p>

<p>
"We've only one first name apiece&mdash;but they're not 'Beryl'
and 'Muriel'; nor are they particularly Christian, that I'm
aware...."  Then the consciousness of their recent loss, and
her new black lisse, displaying a generous amount of slender
black silk-stockinged leg, failed to subdue her girlish sense of
humour.  She clapped her hands and broke into a fit of
laughter while John stared at her uncomprehendingly, the
fountain-pen suspended over the memorandum-book.  "Oh,
don't goggle at me like that!" cried the girl.  "You're too
killing for anything!  And so is your mother, and so is
Maury&mdash;and so are Dad and Mater, and nearly every one in
our set.  And yet I'm Miriam&mdash;and Beryl is Rebekah&mdash;and
poor darling Beauchamp was Benjamin&mdash;though they aren't
going to have it on his memorial card, or stone!  Do we really
forget we're Jews&mdash;or do we all pretend until it's second
nature?  And why do we pretend&mdash;unless we're ashamed!&mdash;and
why on earth should we be ashamed, that's what I want
to know?"
</p>

<p>
Thus Muriel, confessedly Miriam; and John had found no
better answer than:
</p>

<p>
"Why you or any of us should be ashamed I'm hanged if
I know myself!  But if ever I find out I'll write and tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Don't forget!" said Muriel-Miriam.  "I'm coming to the
door to see you off.  Good-bye for now, J. old Bean!  Put
one for Bur'l here;&mdash;" the tip of a pretty, well-manicured finger
indicated a particularly peachy place on Muriel-Miriam's right
cheek,&mdash;"and another of the same on this side, for me.  Ta-ta!
I'll send you lots of cigs, when I know where you're training&mdash;and
parcels no end when you get out to the Front!  And tell
me you'll go in for a Commission, and get a V.C. or
something,&mdash;just to brisk old Bur'l up!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Tell her," said John with somewhat forced and
clumsy humour, masking the slowly-kindling resentment in his
heart, "that I mean to finish up my service in this War a
private in the ranks&mdash;where I began it.  And that when I&mdash;if I
come back, she'll hear me singing: 'They've All Got a Sam
Browne But Me,'&mdash;long before I come in sight."
</p>

<p>
"I shall listen for you!" said Muriel-Miriam, bursting with
laughter, "but you don't think I'm going to give that message,
I hope!"
</p>

<p>
She did not pass it on; but her younger sister Ida, a sharp
child aged thirteen, who happened to be lingering in the
neighbourhood of the umbrella-stand, communicated to Beryl her
lover's parting message; to which,&mdash;or to the superior
attractions of a certain Captain Hawtin-Billson (back from the
Front with a shattered left arm and a Mention in Despatches)
may be attributed Beryl's subsequent breakage of the engagement
between herself and John Hazel, and the return of his
ruby and diamond ring....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
During the strenuous period of training that followed on
John Hazel's joining up, his large reserve-fund of conceit
was lowered by the merciless chaff of the ranks, and the vigorous
language of his platoon-Sergeant, whose little red-veined
eyes, glaring into his own, reflected in their muddiness his
puny insignificance.
</p>

<p>
He learned to put on his puttees properly, clean his accoutrements,
make his bed and condense his pack to regulation limits,
under the instruction of one Lance Corporal Harris,&mdash;an
ex-Boy Scout of appalling efficiency&mdash;as well as to gulp
down his morning mug of tea, in defiance of the probability
of the fluid containing in solution an ounce of Epsom salts.
And by the time the Fourth Battalion of the Fenchurch Street
Fusiliers quitted their training-quarters at Malta, replaced
there by a Fifth Battalion created in the interval&mdash;and were
transferred to the fighting-line in Flanders; he had acquired
the soldier's much-prized gift of summoning sleep at will.
Also, he had learned to dispense with sleep, were the sacrifice
required....  After months of bitter fighting at the Front
he had learned to go unshaven, unwashed, and with unchanged
linen,&mdash;endure the plagues of vermin in a crowded,
unventilated dugout&mdash;share a fag with a man who had none;
smoke the Army gasper in lieu of anything better,&mdash;and
consume biscuit and bully mingled with dirt, and washed down
with burnt-bread coffee; or Pimmington's Perfect Soup
Substitute, boiled in a rusty jam-tin over a Tommy's Cooker,&mdash;with
a gastronomic rapture that a dinner at the Carlton, the
Ritz or the Savoy had previously failed to evoke.
</p>

<p>
Also, John Hazel had learned to hold the Battalion in
limitless esteem; to regard the Regiment he had once despised
as a mob of clerks, shop-boys and warehousemen&mdash;as the pick
and pride of the Territorial Forces, and to graft on the slang
of the modern Londoner, the polyglottic argot of the War.
</p>

<p>
Finally, and subsequently to Beryl's defection, he had
reconstituted his standard of the Ideal in Woman, after what
fashion and under what circumstances may now be set forth.

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
In the April of 1915, east of "that mad place called Ypres,"&mdash;a
city of ruinous white towers reddened by an angry sunrise,
lying ahead and to the left.  A grim grey road leading from
Divisional Headquarters to the battle-front, a double crescent
of blown-in trenches ankle-deep in water, and bottomed with
West Flanders mud.  A road fanged with the stumps of trees
shattered by H.E. and scarred by iron-shod wheels; pitted with
shell-holes, and generally knee-deep in sludge of an adhesive
character.  A road along which progressed, under cover of the
darkness, long columns of men, guns and Army-lorries;
A.S.C. cars and motor-cycles carrying ammunition, supplies, mails
and despatches for the advanced trenches; unless German
star-shell or searchlights made it daylight, when traffic stopped
dead, to move on when the menace passed.
</p>

<p>
Day found the road deserted as a rule, though German hate
played on it regularly at intervals, with rifle and machine-guns
and clouds of poison-gas.  But sometimes under the leaden
scowl of a rainy day, or the brassy glare of a sunny one, the
road displayed a double moving line.  This, when one of the
myriad little wars, presently to be merged in Warfare,&mdash;demanded
the attainment of some objective infinitely insignificant,&mdash;at
the cost of some great sacrifice of human life.
</p>

<p>
On this particular April day, what time the British line
from Ypres southwards was strengthened&mdash;in default of missing
sandbags&mdash;with tins of uneatable jam of the apple-blackberry
brand, and equally bad corned-beef: columns of muddy
Londoners and Scotsmen with helmets and gas-respirators at
the alert, were going up to Support-trenches.  Afoot
now,&mdash;having disembarked at a marked danger-point from the grey
Army lorries&mdash;or green and yellow motor 'buses that had carried
many of the Londoners to business in the days that seemed
so dim and so far off.  And as they went, though shrapnel
burst about them, and High Explosive dug new craters beside
old, and wiped out a platoon or so in doing it,&mdash;they sang to
the accompaniment of mouth-organs; "<i>Keep the Home Fires
Burning</i>," or "<i>Piccadilly</i>," or "<i>I Love a Lassie</i>," or
excruciatingly-parodied hymns.
</p>

<p>
But the troops that were coming down from the fighting-line
to rest-billets (mostly Canadians, red with rust, muddy to
the eyebrows, marching raggedly in companies or jumbled up
anyhow in the lorries), did not sing "<i>The Maple Leaf</i>" or "<i>My
Little Grey Home</i>."  Many wore First Aid bandages smeared
with iodine; nine out of ten hobbled and coughed and vomited;
and the mucus they wrenched from their labouring lungs was
yellow and mingled not infrequently with blood.  It was their
first experience of a German gas-attack, and the horror of
the strange and evil thing was upon them; and the reek of it
was in their clothes and breath.  Yet those who could&mdash;called
out cheerfully to recognised friends; or grinned with their
cracked and swollen mouths in answer to cheery hails.  Their
reddened eyes of sleeplessness stared out of haggard, unshaved
faces, and their muddy shoulders humped under their muddy
kit-packs, as though the muddy ground were drawing them
to lie down upon it and sleep.  And every now and then one
would falter in his stride and smile stupidly; and heavily and
soggily collapse in the gluey mush.  A comrade who had
energy enough left in him would kick and shake such a sleeper
into temporary wakefulness; or one of the men who perched
beside the drivers of the Hospital cars and
ambulances,&mdash;R.A.M.C. orderlies or Red Cross bearers, would play the
Samaritan thus, when the subject would stagger on, to fall
again.  Or room would be made for him in some omnibus or
lorry where lightly-wounded or badly-gassed men were packed
like bloaters in a barrel, and so the game went on.
</p>

<p>
Private John Hazel, crunching a muddy apple, trudged
through the sticky mud as part of a somewhat straggling
route-column representing the Fourth Battalion of the
Fenchurch Street Regiment.  One novel sensation had that
morning thrilled the Terriers, stale with the deadly boredom
of life in the rear lines.  Necks were yet being twisted to get
the last of it, and joyous comments tossed it from tongue to
tongue.  A cow,&mdash;hidden away for months by an ancient
peasant in some subterranean stable in No Man's Land
(whence her milk had been retailed at the price of Veuve
Cliquot to the Canadians in the firing-line)&mdash;was being brought
down to the rear by her proprietor; her late lodgings having
been discovered and thoroughly spring-cleaned by a German
H.E. shell....
</p>

<p>
"Moi hoi, if it be-ant a cow!" said a voice that had the roll
and twang of Berkshire.  "Coosh-coosh, Snowdrop, ole
beauty!"
</p>

<p>
"My Gawd, she don't 'arf look natural, do 'er?" came from
a Cockney tongue....
</p>

<p>
Not a human unit of all those trudging columns but had
slewed his head to stare at Crummy, and sniff the homely
odours of hay and farmyard-muck that shook from her muddy
flanks as she kloop-klooped by.  What though she had raw
patches of mange upon her withers&mdash;testifying to the poorness
of her diet and the closeness of her quarters!  To men who
had not seen a cow, pig, cock or hen for weeks, moving upon
that devastated country of once prosperous farms, productive
fields, fruitful orchards, and stately rural mansions, the sight
was comforting; bringing reassurance that in regions as yet
unscathed by the frightfulness of War, yet were to be found
quiet and order, laughter and pleasure, savoury food, sleep
in one's own bed, and the humble, harmless things of
everyday use, that make life sweet by their very homeliness.
</p>

<p>
Another sensation was in store that day, and though the
novelty of it wore off with retrospection, John Hazel's keen
enjoyment of the episode never blunted....
</p>

<p>
Down through the return-traffic on his left hand side, came
a stately fleet of motor-waggon ambulances of the Red Cross,
British and American; escorted by a train of Auxiliary Army
Service cars of all imaginable makes, nationalities and sizes,
from the aristocratic Rolls-Royce to the runabout Ford; from
the Mercedes-Daimler of the Parisian boulevards to the roomy
Schneider touring-car,&mdash;bringing wounded from the advanced
dressing-stations down to the clearing-hospitals six miles back
of the Reserve Lines.
</p>

<p>
The grey ambulances passed, in a mingled whiff of carbolic
and iodoform: leaving a sense of grey paint, mystery and
merciful swiftness.  The cars, mostly carrying sitting-cases&mdash;flowed
after them; steering neatly among the shell-holes, picking
their way with practised smoothness among the various
obstacles encumbering the road.  And they left behind an
impression of still figures wrapped in brown Army blankets:
and grey-green or livid faces with closed or staring eyes,
shaded by sacking-covered steel hats or bloody bandages: of
an even stronger blast of carbolic and iodoform, and of Beauty,
calm, alert, composed and eminently practical.
</p>

<p>
For all these auxiliary ambulance-cars were driven by
women: in the black leather overcoats of Foreign Service, with
D.B. Kitchener collars, and plain shoulder-straps with the
button of the Red Cross Society's V.A.D.  The pick and pride of
the Old Country they seemed,&mdash;all young, or in the splendour
of the early thirties.  The best blood in Britain, John Hazel
could have sworn,&mdash;raced under the sunburn of those quiet
clear-cut faces, topped by peaked storm-caps of Navy blue
cloth.  He saw the neck of the lieutenant leading his platoon
blaze red between his sweat-blackened collar and the edge of
his tin hat, and the muddy glove swing up in the salute, as a
clear voice rang out gaily from a driving-seat:
</p>

<p>
"He knows one of 'em.  Lucky beast!  I wonder&mdash;"  John
had reached thus far in his conjecture when a pip-squeak burst
overhead with three sharp crashes; and a shell from a German
howitzer dropped in an ancient neighbouring shellpit, considerably
enlarging it&mdash;and producing the fantastic smoke-effect
known as "Woolly Bear."
</p>

<p>
John Hazel bolted the core of his muddy apple, and
mechanically made sure that "they" had not got him this time.
The head under his tin hat was ringing, his eyes and lungs
were full of acrid vapour: but no shrapnel was located in any
portion of his frame.  The cars were running by as smoothly
as ever....  You could see through the thinning fumes the
faces of the drivers, set like rock to confront War's risks and
chances: and a blatant pride in them surged up in John Hazel
and he caught his breath...  They were his countrywomen....
Then Wallis, his front-file man, suddenly fell back upon him,
knocking him breathless with his pack, and cutting his top
lip badly with the edge of his shrapnel hat.  With blood
running over his long chin, blue and stubbly with bad shaving,
John held up Wallis, who was making queer, clucking,
farmyard noises:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Auch&mdash;auch&mdash;auch!</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
"The bloody 'Uns," growled John's left-hand man to his
neighbour, "'as copped pore Ginger!" and the lieutenant ahead
looked around.  Wallis had ceased clucking by now; and the
hand of John's supporting arm, where it went round across
his cartridge-belt under his tunic-pockets, was wet with the
usual warm, sticky stuff.  And a voice that was clear-cut and
ringing called out something, and a car slowed down its
speed, and those behind it swept round and on....  And the
lieutenant was shouting through the myriad noises of traffic:
"If you can, it would be topping of you....  This isn't a
healthy road to stop on.  Thanks frightfully! ... You,
Hazel, hoist him in and catch us up after! ... Forward.
March! ..."
</p>

<p>
The V.A.D. driver had never quite stopped her car, John
Hazel remembered.  She had checked it to a crawl and he had
kept pace with it, carrying the now rapidly-buckling Wallis&mdash;whose
head had dropped forward, and whose helmet had
fallen off&mdash;at the full stretch of his long arms since he stripped
the pack from him.  A Red Cross orderly had taken it
together with Wallis's rifle.
</p>

<p>
"No room behind!" came in the ringing, feminine tones.
"We're four over the proper load already! ... This seat
beside me ...  the orderly can sit on the step.  You'll be all
right there, won't you, Martynside?  Now please lift when
I give the word; <i>Go!</i> ... Don't worry about the blood.  Lean
your head against my shoulder!"  She added for the cheer of
Wallis, who was trying to say something apologetic: "Quite
all right, if you're careful of my steering arm....
Comfortable? ... All right, Martynside!  And&mdash;don't be too anxious
about your friend.  We shall look after him!"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps something in the comrade's gaunt brown face, a
flare of wistfulness burning in his big hollow black eyes had
drawn the attention of the speaker.  As a matter of fact, the
way in which her strong womanly shoulder had swayed to
meet Wallis's limply sagging head, had given John Hazel a
sensation as of plucking at the heartstrings.  And&mdash;where had
he heard that voice before? ... She went on, answering
the hungry look in the gaunt black eyes that met hers:
</p>

<p>
"You shall hear of him, if news can possibly be got to you.
I'll send a post-card if you'll give me your name.  'Private
John Hazel, No. 000, X. Platoon, F. Company, 4th Battalion,
448th City of London Regiment, Support Trenches, Ypres.'  That's
quite all right! ... Your Reserve is at St. Jean....
Hang on to this!"  This being a thick, squat packet of Dundee
Butterscotch.  "Good-bye and good luck! ... You'll be
coming down this way in a week or two."
</p>

<p>
"If I don't get gassed or wounded....  Good-bye and
thanks tremendously!"
</p>

<p>
John grinned, showing his big white teeth with the effect
of a sudden illumination in his gaunt brown face; and there
and then,&mdash;with a snort from the now rapidly-moving car, and
a nod and smile from the driver,&mdash;the little episode had ended.
Leaving John Hazel with a pleasanter flavour upon his mental
palate than the sour American apple had left in his mouth.
Something that was sweet with the aromatic sweetness of the
ripe gold-and-crimson pippin whose rich juices have been
perfected by the lightest touch of frost.  And She had had the
frankest and most candid eyes, of the clearest cairngorm
golden-brown, that John had ever seen in a woman's head,
and a wide, kind, charming mouth, that had shown two rows
of dazzling teeth in a parting smile that had crinkled the eyes
deliciously at the corners....  And so they had parted; going
east and south-west, the V.A.D. to her clearing-hospital, the
Londoner with a new, strange warmth about the heart, catching
up his Company on the edge of a new-made crater, in time
to take over the duty of Harris, now platoon-Sergeant, killed
with three other men by a shell from "Silent Lizzie," the
terrible 5.9 German Navy gun.
</p>

<p>
Thus the mantle of heroism had been transferred to the
broad, unwilling shoulders of John Hazel, from those of the
energetic young N.C.O. who had been to him as a thorn in
the flesh.  He had loathed Harris, with his pink and white
complexion, his auburn quiff, and his appalling, crushing
efficiency.  And Harris, who as a Boy Scout had passed every
imaginable test of ability and gained every badge obtainable,&mdash;had
warmly abhorred John, as the shrieking example of everything
a British soldier should not be....
</p>

<p>
"It's for your good I keep on what you call nagging at
you, Hazel!" would be the introduction to every exordium:
"A dirty soldier is a disgrace to his King and Country, and
that's what you'd be if you couldn't afford to bribe men you
consider your inferiors to wind your puttees tight, and fasten
'em properly, and keep your straps and buckles clean."
</p>

<p>
Or:
</p>

<p>
"It's for your good I follow you up, as you express it; and
when you're able to make a fire out of mud and rotten beet-leaves,
and an 'ot meal out of bully beef, ration-biscuit and
an onion, more like an Egyptian 'All professor of ledgerdemang
than a British Tommy'&mdash;which is like your nerve to use such
language, so much the better it'll be for you!  Don't tell me
you can't keep your puttees from trailin' about your legs like
snakes and the rust from disguising the metal on your
'coutrements.  Don't say you can put up with 'ardships, and that you
mean to stick it, ... To make Bad Better is your duty!  and
to 'unker like an 'og in the slush of Belgium, when you could
sit on a faggot and keep reasonable dryish: and shiver when
you could 'eat yourself inside and out by a bit of
forethought&mdash;is your disgrace and not your praise!"
</p>

<p>
And Harris would light the fire and set the stew going, or
thrust on his unwilling subordinate a portion of his own; and
depart cheerfully whistling, and ostentatiously in possession
of the equable temper which a Scout must never, never
lose!&mdash;leaving the prodded object of his zealousness frothing with
impotent rage.
</p>

<p>
Small wonder that the alert personality of Harris, his
observant glance, unsparing criticism and unfailing Preparedness
in every emergency were,&mdash;with his orange quiff and the
trench-rings on his little fingers&mdash;by Private Hazel utterly
abhorred.
</p>

<p>
After the clubbing of a certain German prisoner who had
treacherously shot a comrade of John's, Harris did not hesitate
to denounce Private Hazel as "a butcherly brute."  Yet dying
on the edge of the big new crater hollowed at the roadside by
"Silent 'Lizzie," he used his last forces to faintly shout in
the stooped ear of his platoon-lieutenant:
</p>

<p>
"Let Hazel carry on in my place, Sir!  He's a filthy fighter&mdash;but
the best man we've got!"
</p>

<p>
So, ex-Scout Harris died, true to the last to his ideals, having
played the game for his side right up to the end....  And
within twenty-four hours of reaching the second-line trenches,
Harris's reluctant deputy, saddled with the necessity of keeping
up Harris's reputation as a daredevil, had led a company to the
support of the front line in the place of a lieutenant wounded&mdash;and
had won the D.C.M. by a single-handed bomb-attack upon
an enemy machine-gun position,&mdash;which enabled our London
Terriers to charge over the parapet and clear out the wasp's
nest.  Had been offered and respectfully declined promotion&mdash;on
the grounds that he didn't like responsibility!&mdash;and
had subsequently, in the act of drinking tea at the door of the
platoon dug-out&mdash;been knocked out of action by a splinter of
shell.
</p>

<p>
Thus, adhering in death as in life to his policy of well-meant
aggravation, Sergeant Harris came between his bugbear and the
promised, longed-for post-card.  For if indeed it had been sent,
it had never reached John....  Damn Harris!  But what good
was there in damning Sergeant Harris?  Hell wasn't the place
you'd catch that efficient young beggar going to.  Hadn't he,
assiduously as he kept his body, looked after his cocky little
soul!  In the gusts of fever that shook his brain as he lay in
his cot at the Receiving Hospital, John pictured Harris with
his quiff all curled and shiny,&mdash;dressed in the spruce white
clothing of the righteous&mdash;heard him with the ears of
imagination, shouting hymns that went with a marching swing.
</p>

The fever subsided by and by, and, after four months of
bitter fighting, Private John Benn Hazel, No. 000, X. Platoon,
F. Company, 4th Battalion, (subsequently to a brief sojourn
at a French Base Hospital) found himself back in Blighty,
well pleased to be alive.  He ended his final period of
residence as a patient at the Auxiliary Military War Hospital of
Colthill in Middlesex, in the July when German South-west
Africa surrendered to Smuts and Botha: and was pronounced
convalescent by the C.M.O. in the first week of December,
1915; the self-same raw, bleak and nipping day that saw the
Fenchurch Streets'&mdash;with other British forces transferred to
the Egyptian Expeditionary&mdash;embark for Salonika.

<p>
The bit of shrapnel irritating his left lung,&mdash;located there
by the X-Ray, but deemed by the surgeons unreachable, had
ceased to bother much; and the gas-bronchitis&mdash;another
souvenir of that mad place called Ypres&mdash;had quieted down to a
wheezy cough.  John was lying back, rather damp and
exhausted after an access of this cough, when the Ward Sister
in charge that afternoon looked round the screen&mdash;there had
been three; but two of them had been taken away because the
patient was getting on so nicely,&mdash;to say that a visitor wished
to speak to him, Number Forty&mdash;if he felt well enough?
</p>

<p>
"Tell the old girl they won't allow me to eat anything but
apples or Brazil-nuts,&mdash;and that I'm not to smoke more than
two cigarettes at a time!"
</p>

<p>
John's homely effort at wit evoked an approving nod and
smile from the Sister.  She vanished as the Hospital porter, a
one-armed ex-Guardsman who previously to Mons had been
a famous Regimental pugilist&mdash;came stepping lightly as a
cat over the highly-polished floor, carrying a 200-weight
coal-bucket.  As the replenished fire began to crackle and blaze,
the Ward Sister returned, ushering a little, frail, bent old man,
with flowing hair and a patriarchal beard of the white that
has passed into straw-colour; sharp twinkling eyes under
penthouse eyebrows lighting a face of innumerable wrinkles,
reddish-pink and leathery like a marmoset's.  He carried a tall
hat in one hand and a brown leather bag in the other, and
wore a black velvet skull-cap, greasy with faithful wear.  A
round-collared, single-breasted overcoat of brown cloth, with
yellow horn buttons, revealed the bottoms of shiny black
trousers, ending in square-toed, black cloth-topped boots.  The
boots were clogged with Middlesex mud, as though he had
walked from the station.  A purple woollen comforter and
mitts to match, defied the December blasts.
</p>

<p>
Firelight played bo-peep on the white ceiling, and chased
dodging shadows in and out between the neat beds, ranged
along the creamy walls of the long, cheerful ward, and winked
in the dark polish of the boards, and was reflected in the
glass-topped tables supporting pots of hyacinths and daffodils as
well as big blue-glass stoppered bottles of Perox: Hydro: and
Mercurial Sol:.  But the unexpected appearance of his ancient
visitor had cast a glamour over Number Forty.  His body
lay in bed in Colthill War Hospital.  But in spirit he stood
in his Grandfather Simonoff's Hull counting-house, a boy of
three in diamond socks, strap-shoes and a blue jean
round-about, straining his sharp young ears for the rustling of a
paper bag.
</p>

<p>
Peppermint rock, brown or white, was John Hazel's darling
weakness.  His letters Home, during his sojourn in the trenches,
had invariably ended with a prayer for more peppermint rock.
And the sight of this queer old man evoked all sorts of
pungent memories connected with the favourite sweet stuff.  His
big black eyes and the sharp little red-veined old eyes met,
and something like an electric shock passed between them.
And the shaggy penthouse eyebrows of the old man came
down, and then shot up to meet his velvet skull-cap&mdash;or the
cap came down to meet them,&mdash;and at the same moment his
ears wagged, and John Hazel knew him again.  Twenty-seven
years were temporarily blotted out, and he was once more a
five-year-old&mdash;and old Mendel was feeling in the pocket that
bulged&mdash;and John Hazel found himself licking his lips&mdash;but
nothing but a blue-spotted cotton handkerchief came out of
the bulgy pocket.  With this, Mendel&mdash;had he ever had another
name?&mdash;loudly blew his nose, and as the Ward Sister placed
a chair, and vanished with a whisk of cotton-print skirts
(notably shorter in this December of 1915 than the previous
uniform pattern), he uttered something in a strange, unknown
and yet familiar tongue:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Shalôm&mdash;shalôm!</i>" He added as he met the astonished
stare of John's gaunt black eyes.  "You are like your father
as pea is like pea; and yet&mdash;when I wish peace to you in the
Holy Tongue, you don't understand me!  A shame and a
sin!&mdash;but I'm not here to reproach you for being a Meshumad!
That's not my affair!  You're not my grandson,&mdash;the Holy
One be praised!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Bartoth&mdash;" John had exhumed the other name by
a strenuous effort of memory: "whether you are pleased to
see me or not, I'm very glad to see you!  Do you object
to shaking hands?"
</p>

<p>
"Behold!"  Mendel blew his nose again loudly, and said as
he restored the blue-spotted handkerchief to the bulgy pocket;
"I am 'Mr. Bartoth' to the child I dandled....  You have
not kept the good way, but there is a good heart in you....
You sit there with your medal on your breast&mdash;" a famous
Divisional Commander, visiting Blighty to enjoy a brief leave,
had looked in at the Hospital on the day previous, and
conferred on Private Hazel&mdash;with some laudatory expressions,
the Medal for Distinguished Conduct in the Field&mdash;"and you're
not too proud to offer your hand to Old Mendel&mdash;nor you've
not forgotten his name!  Yet you were a babe of three years
when your father died, peace be upon him! and but four when
we lost your grandfather, peace be upon him!  and too young
to say Kaddish; and now that your grandfather and your
uncles and your cousins are dead, peace be upon them! you, a
grown man of thirty-three, are ignorant as a babe.  <i>Shaigatz!</i>
But it's no use to be angry.  Besides, I must get back to
London in time to catch the four o'clock Express from St. Pancras.
I came by the 5.48 from Hull and got in at two o'clock noon."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you had anything to eat?&mdash;Won't you&mdash;" John
was beginning when the old man, who had sunk upon the
chair with a boneless limpness eloquently expressive of his
weariness, silenced him with a gesture of fierce abhorrence,
and he was fain to hold his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"I have had all I want.  Do you think my wife sent me
forth upon this journey without provision for my necessities?"  He
had unbuttoned the brown coat and was fumbling in an
inner pocket, from which he finally drew forth a little packet
and a key.  "Here&mdash;this belongs to you.  It comes from your
grandfather Eli Hazaël&mdash;peace be upon him! and may his soul
be bound up in the Bundle of Life!"
</p>

<p>
John received in his big palm a small but heavy something
rolled up in tissue-paper and tied with a little wisp of black
floss silk.  Without opening, he sat staring at it, while Mendel
boggled about opening the shabby brown bag with a tarnished
Bramah key.
</p>

<p>
"How did my grandfather and my uncles and my cousins
die?" he queried, rousing himself from a state of mental
stupefaction accompanied by a profound physical weariness, a
singing in his ears, and a familiar sweetish-saltish taste at the
back of his throat.  And Mendel looked up from rummaging in
the now open bag with his veinous, knotted, shaky old hands,
to say resentfully:
</p>

<p>
"How does any one die in these days except through the
War? ... The people of all the nations of the earth are
tearing at each other's throats&mdash;and not only the young
fighting-men, but the children and the aged, both men and
women!&mdash;these must suffer also....  Soon after the
Ashkenazim&mdash;"  John knew he meant the Germans&mdash;"invaded Belgium, the
Turkish Army was&mdash;what is the word?"
</p>

<p>
"Mobilised.  Yes, the dirty beggars!" said John, employing
a less savoury term than beggar, "they've been stuffed up
with lies about the Kaiser being a Mohammedan, and they're
ready to back him for all they're worth.  At Abu Zenima and
at Tor they gave us plenty of trouble; and they nearly rushed
Aden, last summer, when our best brigades and batteries
serving on the Suez Canal had been sent to the Dardanelles.
Lucky we gave them a gruelling at Serapeum&mdash;and stopped
their little game at mining the waterways of the Canal.  As it
was they jabbed up the Grand Senussi to make Western
Egypt hot for us.  His Bedwân are sniping at British troops
like blazes&mdash;our black garrison at Port Sollum are just sitting
on their thumbs.  But anyhow we're keeping up our end
at Anzac and Gallipoli, and my crowd will be helping, I expect,
pretty soon.  They've&mdash;damn this beastly cough!  They've&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tsch&mdash;tsch!</i>"
</p>

<p>
John stared as Mendel, who raised himself from stooping
nearly double over the bag, gesticulated at him violently with
papers in his withered claws.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tschah!</i> ... Have I time to hear you tell of what is in
the newspapers these three weeks back? ... What I have to
do is to make known to you what the British Press thinks not
worth telling&mdash;the griefs of our people&mdash;and the manner of
their deaths.  The idolaters&mdash;accursed be they! mobilised after
the Invasion.  As their Young Turk Constitution of 1909
made Arabs, Christians and Jews equally liable to military
service, your cousins,&mdash;like all other young men of the
district,&mdash;were marched to the recruiting office by the Turkish
soldiers who accompanied the <i>mouchtar</i> who came with the lists.
They were not allowed to return home for food, or money,
or clothing,&mdash;or to obtain the blessing of their parents,&mdash;but
hurried off to the <i>Hân</i>, locked up like animals with hundreds
of filthy Arabs: and sent from thence like prisoners&mdash;bare-footed
and half-naked&mdash;to reinforce the garrisons in Northern
Galilee.  And your grandfather&mdash;he was living at the house
of his son Isaac, a country place near Haffêd&mdash;for years were
growing heavy on Eli Hazaël....  Even the strong back bows
under the burden of ninety-nine!  And the spirit of Prophecy
came on him as he watched the young men Elias and Jacob
departing,&mdash;and he turned to his son Isaac and said: 'They will
not return, they are gone from us for ever, and you and your
brother will be the next to go!'  This was on the 8th of August
of the Christian Era 1914, or, as we say, the 30th Ab of
5674....  Meanwhile the German Consul at Haifa is going
about the country, preaching to the Arabs how Germans are
not Christians like the French or British, but Children of
Mohammed the camel-driver, and worshippers of the Black
Stone.  And that their Kaiser is the Messiah of Islam:&mdash;and
in all their Mosques prayers are made for the Sultan and
Hadji&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bill! ... Haw-haw!" John guffawed, pleased and tickled
by his own apt joke.
</p>

<p>
"Peace, boy! and let me finish.  This is no <i>chine</i> to set a
<i>Schlemihl</i> grinning.  There is blood in it and anguish, and
tears!  For Jewish and Christian recruits at the training-camps
were disarmed and stripped of their uniforms,&mdash;(khaki
and <i>enveriehs</i> which most had bought new at Turkish value
for fear of getting infected garments),&mdash;and put to labour
under the whips of Turkish gang-masters in the <i>taboor amlieh</i>.
Those are the working-corps that are building a new railway-branch
of the Central Palestine from El Tineh in Philistia
southwest to Gaza and southward to Beersheba&mdash;and making
military roads for the Turks between Saffed and Tiberias&mdash;in
case the railways should be cut off by the British by and by!
And others are sent to labour at construction-camps at Hebron
and Samaria.  While at home in the other towns of Palestine
and the villages of the Colonies&mdash;the goods of Christians and
Jews were requisitioned, and silver and gold and jewels
plundered; fences torn up and olive-groves cut down, and evil
worked in many ways.  Worse than all, shame has been
brought upon the matrons and daughters of Israel, even such
as Esther, the only daughter of your Uncle Isaac, a virgin of
eighteen years!"
</p>

<p>
John flushed dark purple under his mahogany skin and
rapped out an ugly epithet:
</p>

<p>
"Who was the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; hound?"
</p>

<p>
"He is one Hamid Bey, a Colonel of Turkish gendarmerie,
Vali of the labour-camps near Nazareth&mdash;high in the
confidence of the Turkish commander of their Eighth Army Corps,
and, like all the rest of the idolaters, lustful as an ape.  And
she&mdash;<i>Achi Nebbich!</i> she was as a rose of Sharon!  And word
came to her brother Jacob, who was working with the road-gangs
at Tiberias, his cousin Elias being a labourer on the
railway near Beersheba&mdash;peace be upon them!  Therefore,
Jacob, with one Reuben Ephraim&mdash;their playmate from childhood,
and a fellow-labourer&mdash;who had an affection for Esther&mdash;as
she unto him, poor creature!&mdash;broke out of camp and
struck across the hills to Nazareth&mdash;careless of peril, raging
like furious wolves."
</p>

<p>
"Wish I'd had the chance to make one of the party!" John
murmured.  Old Mendel's croaking voice went on:
</p>

<p>
"Now these two had determined to purchase exemption from
service,&mdash;notwithstanding that they were already enrolled,&mdash;for
such things can be done where the officers are Turks!&mdash;and
they brought with them the money, forty gold pieces of twenty
francs for each,&mdash;that is eighty pieces!&mdash;meaning to buy with
them the honour of the girl!  They found out where Hamid
Bey was quartered&mdash;in the large new <i>Khân</i> near the <i>Hammâm</i>
that is at the north-east end of Nazareth, looking towards
the fig-orchards and vineyards and olive-groves that are as a
green fringe upon the borders of the Tiberias Road.  News
had come through that Turkey was at War, and there was
terror in the hearts of the people....  First, the French
Christian Orphanage&mdash;then the Scotch Medical Mission&mdash;then
every hospital, school, convent or mission in the town had
been taken over by the Turkish Army Corps' Commander for
military uses&mdash;and Jewish and European houses were gutted
by the score.  The streets were full of howling rioters&mdash;there
was concealment in such confusion,&mdash;so the young men lurked
in the gardens through the day, and Jacob kept close to the
sentry-posts and heard the password&mdash;thus when dusk fell
they passed the sentries, and came into the lower part of the
<i>Khân</i>.  And with cunning they made their way up to the Bey's
apartment&mdash;and found him there with Esther.  <i>Achi Nebbich!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Mendel's parchment forehead was wet with perspiration.  He
mopped it and went on, screwing up his nose and blinking:
</p>

<p>
"When she leaped from the divan shrieking and fell upon
her face at the feet of her brother and lover, the Bey's eyes
barely followed her,&mdash;he was already weary of his toy.  He
covered the boys with his big German Army revolver&mdash;his
companion even in pleasure&mdash;and told them that he was
willing to hear what they had to say....  They said it, and
offered the money&mdash;as the price&mdash;not of Esther's honour&mdash;for
she was ruined already!&mdash;but to purchase her deliverance from
slavery with him."
</p>

<p>
The veins on John's forehead were swollen and blackening.
Mendel's voice had sunk to a penetrating hiss.
</p>

<p>
"The Turk&mdash;may Fire from Heaven consume him!&mdash;was
immovable by arguments and deaf to prayers.  He would take
the eighty gold pieces&mdash;what Turk can resist money!&mdash;but his
Jewish concubine he would keep also.  Then Jacob asked to
speak to Esther apart.  No farther than the end of the room,
distant from the door and windows....  To this the Bey
agreed, smiling, turning his tongue between his lips,
and&mdash;keeping the German Army revolver&mdash;they all have them&mdash;and
Zeiss binoculars!&mdash;ready in his hand.  Then&mdash;Reuben says:&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Was it <i>he</i> who told you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of that presently!  Then Jacob embraced Esther and
Reuben as one that taketh farewell for a journey&mdash;while
Reuben watched them shudderingly, knowing what should come!
The Turk signed that Jacob should hand him the bag of money&mdash;and
this Jacob did.  Bowing obsequiously before the son of
Satan&mdash;who, thrusting the revolver in its pouch&mdash;gripped the
bag, with one hand&mdash;and with the other patted the youth upon
the cheek that was as fair as Esther's&mdash;and touched with the
first growth of the black silken down...."
</p>

<p>
John would have said "Go on," but he couldn't.  The little,
eyes like glowing embers held him spellbound, as they burned
into his own....
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly Jacob sprang like a leopard on the revolver,
wrenched it away and leapt to his feet.  The Bey set his
whistle to his lips and blew,&mdash;and his servants and orderlies
came running in tumultuously.  But not so quickly but that
two shots had cracked out&mdash;and the room was ringing!&mdash;and
the brown cordite smoke hung under the ceiling in a thin
cloud, smelling of aniseed, and mingled with the smell of
scorched flesh and hair.  For&mdash;Jacob&mdash;peace be upon
him!&mdash;had thrust the pistol-muzzle close against the girl's temple
when he shot her&mdash;and fired the next bullet into his own
mouth!"
</p>

<p>
"How on earth did Reuben get off?"
</p>

<p>
"He cannot tell me.  The Lord knoweth!  But he found
himself running through the night like a deer,&mdash;with shots and
shouts dying out upon the distance&mdash;and when he ran into the
dawn of the mild November day, lo! there was blood upon
his naked feet!  Esther's and Jacob's! ... But why should
there have been blood upon his hands, and a dagger in
one of them&mdash;bloody also? ... He does not know! ... A
frenzy was upon him.  The country was searched for him,
but he had found a friend who kept him well hidden.  He was
the American Consul at Jaffa, and in the safety of his shadow
Reuben dwelt for many days.  Then he found means to
communicate with his family.  From them he learned that
Elias&mdash;the cousin of Jacob and Esther who was working on the
Beersheba Railway,&mdash;had suffered the punishment of the
<i>falagy</i>.  Why?  For abetting his cousin&mdash;of whose deed he
knew not!&mdash;in an attempt upon the life of the Bey at
Nazareth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What is the <i>falagy</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"The bastinado.  Beating with green rods&mdash;<i>asâyisi</i>."
</p>

<p>
"On the soles of the feet.  Oh&mdash;well!  One's often heard
of that, hasn't one?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Schlemihl!</i>  Are there not beatings and beatings?  The
<i>asâyisi</i> to punish&mdash;the <i>asâyisi</i> to maim and torture!  The
<i>asâyisi</i> until there is no shape of humanity left in the body,
and even the mother of the man would not know the putrid
mass of bloody flesh for the child she bore and bred!  So thy
cousin Elias died.  And after that there was no peace for the
house of thy grandfather Eli.  His son Amos, and Shemuel,&mdash;the
second son of Amos,&mdash;were mobilised to go south with
Labour Corps of Jews and Syrians....  Digging trenches
for the Turks to hold the railway at El Arish, they dug their
own graves, upon them be peace!  The two sons of their sister
Sara were taken prisoner by the British at Kantara, and
related their story, and were kindly used.  They joined the Zion
Mule Corps and went to Gallipoli.  Perhaps they live,
perhaps they met their deaths&mdash;carrying ammunition under
shell-fire on the Peninsula!  But they are the sons of
daughters&mdash;not the sons of sons!  To make an end&mdash;being warned that
the vengeance of Hamid was to fall upon his house, thy
Uncle Isaac&mdash;the father of Esther and Jacob&mdash;took the child
that remained to him, even Benjamin, his darling&mdash;who was
not of age to serve,&mdash;and with money and papers hidden upon
them, the two escaped in disguise.  I will not tell you after
what fashion&mdash;but wives and mothers are cunning at these
deceits when their dear ones are in danger!&mdash;and father and son
arrived in safety at Beirut."
</p>

<p>
"And did they get away?"
</p>

<p>
"Woe, woe!  Isaac was recognised by the Turkish wharf-inspector
even as he lifted the boy into the boat that was to
take them to the American steamer.  They were dragged to
prison&mdash;they died in prison, and that last blow slew your
grandfather.  Peace,&mdash;peace upon them all!  The wives of
Amos and Isaac live still, and two of Amos's daughters; but
what are women to a house that needs sons that are begotten
of sons!  Now that the old man's white hairs have been
brought to the grave by sorrow, the house of Eli Hazaël is
represented by whom?"  Mendel blew his nose sonorously
and finished: "Whom but your brother Maurice and yourself!"
</p>

<p>
John was conscious at the back of his mind of a tingle of
eager&mdash;let us call it expectation.  He asked, carefully
divesting his tone of excitement in any undue degree.
</p>

<p>
"Do I understand that&mdash;there's money in this business?"
</p>

<p>
"There is much property, both in land south of Mount
Carmel, and in the export business-houses at Alexandria, and at
Jaffa and elsewhere.  There is money lying at the <i>Crédit
Lyonnais</i>," John's black eyes kindled.  "Also at the <i>Deütsche
Palästina</i> Bank Branch at Jaffa,"&mdash;John whistled dismally&mdash;"and
the Anglo-Palestine Banking Co."&mdash;John blew a sigh
of relief.  "And there is the stewardship of the olive-groves
and vineyards of Kir Saba&mdash;the title-deeds of which property
(the original mortgage on it having now expired, and the sum
lent having been recovered, with the interest)&mdash;must&mdash;this is
the word of your grandfather!&mdash;be formally given over to
those to whom it rightfully belongs.  Here!  Take the
documents!  Thou hast the ring aready!"
</p>

<p>
Mendel jumped up quite briskly, and deposited a double-handful
of documents, account-books and bank pass-books
of foreign appearance and exotic odour, in the hollow where
the coverlet dipped between John Hazel's knees.
</p>

<p>
"A copy of your grandfather's Will is with them&mdash;"  He
picked out a long, tough, yellow envelope, directed in a round
Levantine banking-house handwriting to "John Ben Hazaël,
Esquire, London, England," and resumed: "This is it.  The
original is in the keeping of the old gentleman's solicitors,
'Abel Manasseh, Ephraim &amp; Co., Rue Jerusalem,
Jaffa.'  Reuben,&mdash;who brought the news and the papers!&mdash;is the junior
partner in the firm.  There's a holograph letter from your
grandfather, peace be upon him! written in Hebrew&mdash;and a
sheet with a translation I have made for you, seeing that you,
Eli Hazaël's heir, know nothing of the Holy Tongue!"
</p>

<p>
"His heir! ... Look here! ... You ain't talking through
your hat when you say there's a goodish property?"
</p>

<p>
"Your English slang sounds unto me as Hebrew to you, a
mere gibberish without sense or meaning!"&mdash;Mendel shook off
the large, loose grip of the young man from his arm.  "The
Sons of Perdition&mdash;the Turks!&mdash;have wasted and spoiled
much land that lay under cultivation; and the wine-vaults of
the Colonies have been gutted, by those of them who break
the Law of their Prophet,&mdash;and also by their German Allies.
Also, of the money in the Deütsche Palästina little, if any,
may be recovered now.  But, despite this, and the provision for
the females living&mdash;there is still a great property!  Supposing
three hundred and eighty thousand pounds British," the
glowing eyes were watching John's face narrowly: "is enough to
make it worth your while to live as a good Jew?"

<p>
"What? ... Who? ... Me! ... Great Moses in the Bulrushes!" ...
</p>

<p>
"Profane not the name of the Lawgiver," said Mendel
sternly.  "Is it not reasonable that the father of your father
should desire you to cast off your Epicureanism, take upon
you the Yoke of the Torah, and cease to become a sinner in
Israel?"
</p>

<p>
"Reasonable&mdash;from his point of view!  But&mdash;Me kiss a
Mezuzah nailed on the doorpost, and reel off long prayers in
a synagogue with my hat on&mdash;and my head wrapped in a
shawl!"
</p>

<p>
"The Orthodox would respect instead of despising you."
</p>

<p>
"But my own set!  What price they, I should like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Their price&mdash;do you ask their price?"  The fierce eyes
flashed, the beaky nose looked capable of pecking.  "For half
of the great sum that is in question, there are not three among
your associates&mdash;lewd men and loose women!&mdash;that would not
kiss the buttocks of the Goat of Mendes, and spit upon the
Cross!  For they are not even Christians.  They are as the
brutes that perish.  And you&mdash;another brute!&mdash;plant your
hoofs and lay your ears back&mdash;and bite at the hand that tries
to pluck you by the garment back from the brink of the
bottomless Abyss!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here! ..."
</p>

<p>
Under the accusing glare of Mendel's little red-hot eyes,
various deviations from the straight path of morality
condoned by John as natural and even pardonable,&mdash;assumed a
much less harmless character, and even took on an ugly and
sinister hue....
</p>

<p>
Since John Hazel had left school at the age of eighteen, a
string of young women of garish attractions and uncommonly
easy virtue,&mdash;flaunting blossoms plucked by the wayside&mdash;in
the City or the West End&mdash;had succeeded one another in his
temporary affections.  There had been several more or less
quite serious entanglements, one of which had threatened to
effloresce in a Divorce Case, but fortunately had not.  There
had been&mdash;previous to John's engagement&mdash;numberless rather
rowdy jaunts; all-night Launch Parties; excursions to Pleasure
Resorts: Seaside-hotel, Thames-side-hostelry-Saturday-to-Mondays,&mdash;enjoyed
by John as member of an association,
small, select, eclectic, expensive; rather artistic, decidedly
sporting; semi-literary, slightly theatrical and wholly
Bohemian in character,&mdash;rejoicing in the title of the Cocky-Locky
and Henny-Penny Club.
</p>

<p>
Not so out-and-out Improper, these gay and giddy galas....
Of course you couldn't take your mother to them! but you
could, with a little careful editing, tell her amusing stories
about them&mdash;now and then.
</p>

<p>
It was at a symposium of Club members, assembled at a
riverside hostelry in the summer of 1913, that John had
encountered Birdie Bright.  Ostensibly a Beauty of the Chorus,
Birdie, a young person of lowly origin, pronounced good looks,
accommodating affections and expensive tastes in jewelry, furs,
sweets and <i>lingerie</i>, had played the part of Zobeide to John's
Harûn Er Raschid&mdash;practically until the arrival of Beryl on
the scene.
</p>

<p>
She had vowed herself "broaken harted" in several despairing
letters, written in an immense angular hand in ink of
vivid green, upon sheets of pink ribbed note.  But John had
been generous&mdash;even Birdie admitted it!&mdash;as she took his
advice, and put away the consolatory wad of crisp ten-pound
notes that had sweetened the bitterness of parting, carefully
in the Brixton Branch of a solid and reliable Bank.
</p>

<p>
Since Beryl's heartless breakage of her betrothal vows, the
image of Miss Birdie Bright, previously effaced from the
surface of John's heart, had revived in all its pristine charm
through the whitewash that had coated it.  To a letter from
John in Hospital, Birdie had effusively responded&mdash;in
passionate purple ink this time,&mdash;and in a bigger hand-writing than
ever.  The telegram appointing a day and an hour for her visit
to her erstwhile lover's bedside was written, and wrapped
round a half-crown in the pocket of his pyjama-jacket, in
readiness for despatch.
</p>

<p>
That wire would have been sent an hour ago&mdash;had not the
convalescent Sapper of Engineers&mdash;to whom belonged the
next bed&mdash;gone off in such a hurry to the Pictures with his
young woman that he forgot&mdash;and now Birdie would never
get it!  Nor would the letter enclosing John's cheque, soliciting
from the Secretary of the Cocky-Locky and Henny-Penny
Club, re-election as a member of that interesting association,
ever be posted now....
</p>

<p>
Seen through the stern medium of Old Mendel's spectacles,
the periodical revels of the C.L.H.P. took on a tinge
of hellishness&mdash;became a very Witches' Sabbat.  And Birdie,
viewed through the same merciless, unsparing lenses, became
even as one of the harpies that devour young men and lead
them in the Way of Destruction.

<p>
"And what more is required of you, young man," the
harsh voice went on croaking, "in return for this fortune, than
to carry out the instructions of your elders: to follow cleanliness;
to do justly; to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
God!  But I have done.  Time does not avail for more.  Study
what is written on that paper I have pinned within the letter
in Hebrew.  I am old, and the fountain of my tears is dry,
but mine eyes were moistened when the good old man
entreated of his last descendant&mdash;even with his foot upon the
threshold of Death....  Stay, I will read to you his letter.
Listen to this!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>John, son of John, my youngest and best-beloved!  All thine
elders being removed by the Will of the Most High, it falls to
thee to take upon thee the Guardianship of the Sacred Ashes,
and the Keeping of the Ancient Shrine.  Thou wilt not refuse?
Oh, child of my child!&mdash;the hand that pens this page, before my
very eyes into the dust is crumbling.  Wouldst thou live as
long?  Then be dutiful.  Wouldst thou be happy?  Happiness
is the gift of Heaven, but a good conscience brings peace.
Seek then the peace, and happiness will follow.  If the dying
prayer of an old man is granted, Those Others that have been
before me may be permitted to guide thee in the Way wherein
thou shouldst go.  Farewell!  Forget not to say Kaddish for
thy father's father;&mdash;Eli Ben Hazaël.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The voice: not Old Mendel's croak, but a deep voice rolling
out of the mist of centuries, wakening sub-conscious memories,
thrilling along the nerves to energise long-atrophied cells
in the listener's brain, ceased: and the icy thrills left off
coursing down John Hazel's spinal column, and his strong, wiry
hair left off bristling and lay down.  The paper crackled as
it was thrust once more into the envelope, and tossed back
upon John's lap.  John said, clearing his throat and speaking
with some degree of huskiness:
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite tumble to the meaning of all this about the
Guardianship of the Ashes and the Keeping of the Shrine,
but, of course, I'd say Kaddish for him&mdash;like a bird&mdash;if I
knew it!  I'm not quite such a howling brute as you seem to
think!  Didn't you make me say it for my father when I was
a little kid in petticoats?  I seem to remember something of
the kind."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I did, was it not a good deed?  But now that you
are man grown you have cast off the faith of your fathers.
And Kaddish cannot lawfully be said by one who is not a
Jew!  When you have made up your mind whether you will
be a rich Jew&mdash;or a heathen no better off than many
others&mdash;write to me at your uncle's Hull address!"  Mendel, who had
resumed his seat, snapped his mouth shut, and snapped shut
the calfskin bag&mdash;and stood up and went on&mdash;in the act of
buttoning the single-breasted brown great-coat.  "As to the
Shrine, it's at Alexandria, and the Ashes are naturally where
the Shrine is&mdash;not that I've any information to give you on
that point.  But the other&mdash;less sacred obligation&mdash;you may
discharge as soon as you see fit.  The accounts and the
documents touching Kir Saba&mdash;some of them are very old and
should be handled carefully!&mdash;must be taken to Scotland and
delivered to the representatives of the original mortgagor,
whose address is there written&mdash;by no other hands than your
own.  A gift of five hundred pounds English has been
bequeathed you by your grandfather,&mdash;without further condition
than that you render him this service.  The cash will be
paid you by a cheque upon London as soon as I receive the
receipt for the documents.  You will naturally not part with
them without receiving this acknowledgment.  Take care!
Haven't I warned you?"
</p>

<p>
John's big fingers were prying into a flat wallet of mouldy
parchment sewn with something like ancient silkworm-gut, and
containing an oblong of crumbly brown....
</p>

<p>
"What on earth is it? ... It looks like seaweed....  Or
an old felt sole out of somebody's boot! ..."
</p>

<p>
"It is the original Title Deed of the Tower of Kirjath
Saba and the lands about it, granted by the Emperor
Vespasian to the Tribune Justus Martius, of the Tenth Roman
Legion: on the tenth day of the month of Ab&mdash;that is, August,
in the second year of his reign."
</p>

<p>
"My holy hat!  That was Anno Domini 70, when the Romans
under Titus took the Temple at Jerusalem and burnt&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not burned but demolished, according to Josephus&mdash;the
walls of the Upper City alone being left standing&mdash;to shelter
the garrison chosen from the Roman Tenth Legion!&mdash;together
with the three great towers built by Herod&mdash;in order to
demonstrate to Posterity how glorious a city had been cast
down....  Woe! for the madness and the wickedness of the Pagans.
Alas! for the Sacred City, a chattel in the hands of the
filthy unbeliever even to this day!  Who shall restore the
glory of Jerusalem, or give back life to the dead place, or
cleanse the robe of snowy wool that hath been defiled by
pitch?"
</p>

<p>
"I've heard you reel off things like this before, haven't I,
when I was a little beggar?  I say!  Do you know this rotten
old sheepskin is pretty well priceless?  Why, it's about one
thousand eight hundred and forty-five years old!  Those
Johnnies at the British Museum would hand over a pot of
cash for it."
</p>

<p>
"Have I not told you to lose no time in returning the
document to its owner?  Let him deal with it as he will!  There
is another parchment, the original Deed of Mortgage dated
in your Christian Era 1146.  Money was lent by Issachar Ben
Hazaël, of Joppa (they spell it 'Jaffa' in these days)&mdash;to
the Mortgagor, Sir Hugh Forbys, (they write his name
'Hew'), Knight, and lord of the Strong Tower of Kir
Saba, in return for the right of user of the Tower, with its
groves, gardens, springs and vineyards; and all the 'purtnans'
for the 'makyn of wine.'  When the cash with the interest,
should be recovered, the Title-Deed was to be given back
to Forbys....  These later records continue unbroken up to
the June of the Christian year 1914.  Examine them at your
leisure.  They are faithfully translated and clearly typed."
</p>

<p>
John answered and said unto the aged man, not being
unmindful of the bequest of £500.
</p>

<p>
"You make my head spin, chuckling about centuries as
though they were marbles!  But I give you my word of
honour, I'll swot all the documents up.  When have I to go
down to hand them over to these Scotch people? ... I
suppose they do have some sort of a name?" ...
</p>

<p>
"They are a family of high repute and ancient standing
on the Border.  The Forbis of Kerr's Arbour, Tweedburgh,
N.B.  Have you at any time heard of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Never in my natural!  They seem to have been thunderingly
pally with us Hazels somewhere about the Bronze Age....
Do you know 'em at all?" ...
</p>

<p>
"Ask not foolish questions.  What are the people to me?
For a reason that the documents will clearly explain to you,
they have had no intercourse with your family since the time
of the Seventh Crusade."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder whether they'll be likely to know me when they
see me?"
</p>

<p>
"Be not a Schlemihl!  Where is the ring?"
</p>

<p>
"Which ring?  You know, my head is fairly buzzing with
all this business! ... You've dropped on me like a sandbag
out of an Observation Rupert.  Here&mdash;I've got it!  Some
ring!" ...
</p>

<p>
"It is a black onyx, a Greek gem of price, carved with a
head of the Pagan Hercules and in an ancient setting of gold.
It was given to your ancestor, Hazaël Aben Hazaël, by the
Roman Prætor Philoremus Florens Fabius, at Alexandria, in
the reign of the Pagan Emperors Diocletian and Maximianus&mdash;about
the beginning of the fourth century of the Christian
Era."  Mendel added as John groaned again at this fresh
evidence of antiquity, "This signet now belongs to you as
head of the House of Hazaël.  Let me see you put it on the
third finger of your right hand!"
</p>

<p>
John obeyed.  The great ring fitted the big finger as though
it had been made for it.  The intaglio, worn thin by time
and chipped at the edges, was still beautiful, and though the
tiny Greek letters at the lower left-hand corner signified
nothing to its new owner&mdash;the signed work of a master-hand.
John commented:
</p>

<p>
"He must have been a hefty chap, that old Hazaël!"
</p>

<p>
Mendel responded, buttoning up the brown overcoat:
</p>

<p>
"Your race have always been noted for breeding men of
extraordinary strength and stature.  There is a fellow-ring
to this, I am given to understand, in the possession of the
Forbis family.  It is in high relief, this being the intaglio.
Remember, you will bequeath the signet to your elder son,
after you: as an heirloom which must always be in the
possession of the chief male of the line."
</p>

<p>
"Carrying on as though one was Rob Roy M'Gregor," John
remarked mentally.  Then as Mendel made a strangle-knot
in the purple woollen comforter, adjusted his mittens and was
about to re-lock the brown bag:
</p>

<p>
"Here," he said suddenly, "you had better keep this for
putting those papers in.  Can't leave them lying about on the
bed!  It's a bit old, like me, and the worse for wear, like both
of us.  But I shan't improve, and you're getting over the
wound you got"&mdash;he jerked his thumb as indicating a
locality,&mdash;"over there.  In the trenches.  In Belgium."
</p>

<p>
John explained at some length, Mendel seeming to expect
it&mdash;that the bit of shrapnel in his lung-tissue was of
exceedingly small size.  That the symptoms of slight pain and
breathlessness which had persisted long after the healing of the
chest-wound, had almost vanished under treatment which had
involved absolute rest: the avoidance of talking; a sitting
position maintained constantly, and small but frequent doses of
morphia.
</p>

<p>
"Morphia, eh?  Dangerous stuff.  Done with it now, let's
hope!" said Mendel jerkily.  "Put back the papers in the bag
when I've gone, and mind you always keep it locked!  Look
here!&mdash;I've left you the key.  And so you're convalescent!"  He
went on in quite a different tone, suggesting that he had
only dropped in to inquire about the patient's health about
five minutes previously: "Well, well!  And going out of
Hospital in another week&mdash;I think you said?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite that, I didn't say!" pronounced John in his
English.  "The C.M.O. pronounces me Posh, and the Military
Medical Examination Board'll be sure to certify me Fit for
Service.  I expect to be drafted out to the Mediterranean
pretty shortly&mdash;my battalion of the Regiment having got
transferred to the Eastern Expeditionary Force."
</p>

<p>
"Say not to Gallipoli, that shambles whither British soldiers
are sent as sheep to the slaughter!  Stay, I babble
foolishly!  Have I not knowledge that the British forces were
yesterday withdrawn?"
</p>

<p>
"The hell you have!  Why, where did you get it?"
</p>

<p>
"I made no reference to the Place of Burning.  As to my
knowledge, it is common to the elders among our people: a
nation that received enlightenment from the Most High in
dreams and visions, when the naked woad-daubed savages of
these British Isles were howling to the Moon....  Make not
calf's eyes at me! ... Did not naked savages cry news for
hundreds of miles from hill-top to hill-top in the War with
the Booren!&mdash;and was not the murder of the Gentile General
Gordon at Khartoum known within the hour to the idolaters
in Damascus!  What I tell you is&mdash;there is no doubt at all!"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but&mdash;they don't say a word about it in the papers!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Prrtsch</i>!  Is not that what the papers are for?  And now,
when do you think to get back to business?  I mean business
in the City&mdash;not that of killing other men.  Though, as to
the slaying of enemies," added Mendel, with strange yellow
fire burning under his shaggy eyebrows, "the Kings and
warriors of Hebrew race have slain when slaying was necessary.
Saul his thousands and David his tens of thousands and
Joshua&mdash;who knows how many hundreds of thousands of the
Amorites and Canaanites!  Nay, in your own veins there runs
the blood of famous men of battle.  You should inherit, with
your frame and muscles, a measure of their fighting blood."
</p>

<p>
"Can that be why I sing whenever there's a scrap on?"
asked John, reflectively rubbing his ear.
</p>

<p>
"When scraps are on what?  Tell me again, employing
plainer language," acidly commanded the old man.
</p>

<p>
"I mean, when I've&mdash;not often it's not been&mdash;worse luck!"
returned the young man in his slipshod grammar, "but now
and then&mdash;come really to close quarters with the&mdash;the enemy,
you know." ...
</p>

<p>
"The Germans?  Have no fear!&mdash;I am a Damascus Jew
and not an Hebrew of the Ashkenazim....  It matters not a
<i>yod</i> to me how many you have killed.  What is this about
singing&mdash;when do you sing?"
</p>

<p>
John scowled and the dark red flush began to creep up
under his dull brown skin.  He said gruffly, avoiding the
inquisitive old eyes that raked him, by looking past the edge of
his sole remaining screen down the vista of the long, clean,
shining ward, at the big fire blazing in a deep old-fashoined
grate....
</p>

<p>
"Why, at first when I went to the Front&mdash;no amount of
stabbing stuffed sacks and shooting at dummy men&mdash;and
bombing others&mdash;could"&mdash;his prominent Adam's apple jumped
as he gulped, and his speech came from him in spurts of
broken sentences&mdash;"bring me to swallow the idea of&mdash;killing
them.  Well!&mdash;first two hours of the Real Thing&mdash;I was sick
and cold with sheer fright&mdash;just gibbering with horror!  Then
we advanced, went in with the bayonet&mdash;and I&mdash;began to
like it, quite!  Though when&mdash;some of us&mdash;got back and I
saw&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;Hair and a&mdash;a&mdash;Blood on my&mdash;on mine!&mdash;that
I'd got to clean off or get Hell from the Sergeant!&mdash;I was
as sick&mdash;I give you my word!&mdash;as a chap who's been ordered
to drink a tin-cupful of cold-drawn castor without a bit o'
lemon to chew.  Well, then, you see, as I was retching, comes
along the N.C.O. and hands me out some chaff!  'Sick now
bedad!' he was a wiry little Irishman, with a brogue thicker
than the mud&mdash;'Sick, are ye?&mdash;the big bucko that was singin'
as he hoisted Huns to glory wid the Haymaker's Lift!'  Well,
of course I thought the beggar was joking&mdash;but next time&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, yea!&mdash;what happened the next time?"
</p>

<p>
Old Mendel rubbed his withered hands and smiling widely,
revealed the fact that his still sound and white teeth were
worn down quite level with the gums.
</p>

<p>
"Next time? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Next time was&mdash;rather a personal affair.  Mind you&mdash;I've
never talked about this to any other Service fellow.  There's
something different about their point of view.  It was in
March last&mdash;we'd been doing reserves at Richebourg St. V.&mdash;in
the Neuve St. Chapelle racket, and after the battle we were
taking our turn in the front-line trenches and making
barricades!  Shooting, you may guess, for all we were worth,
and Fritz was handing it back with the Mauser, besides
throwing 15 and 17-inch shells at us and enfilading our parapet
with sprays of bullets from one of their machine-guns.  The
air was full of bangs and squeals and whistles, and every
minute men were toppling over: and the fellow on my right
was a pal of mine: we'd chummed up together like&mdash;a&mdash;like
bricks!  Well, there was a badly wounded German near, lying
outside in the thick of it.  Harding&mdash;my chum&mdash;put down his
gun, gave me a wink&mdash;went over the top&mdash;sniped at like
anything!&mdash;brought the lousy beggar back&mdash;gave him a drink,&mdash;put
a coat under his head: and stowed him away behind us
at the bottom of the trench, to wait for the stretcher-bearers.
Then he came back to his place by me, loaded and went on
shooting."
</p>

<p>
"And then?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, he&mdash;my pal&mdash;Harding&mdash;started rotting in his usual
way; and I'd just said to him in my usual way, 'Do dry up,
you silly, brainless lunatic!' when a revolver banged behind
us, and Harding fell over on me, and I was all one smother
with blood and brains&mdash;<i>his</i>!  When I'd just told him he
hadn't&mdash;you see the point of it?"  John's mouth was stretched
in laughter, but he shuddered as though cold.
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;"  Old Mendel's eyes were fierce under their bushy
brows as he nodded, saying:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Day&mdash;day</i>! ... It does not need to be more plain.  I
understand thee clearly.  The German lying at the bottom
of the trench had shot the man who brought him in, through
the head, from behind....  We have wolves in the
Anti-Lebanon&mdash;and when taken they will fight to the death....
It is wisest to despatch them at once with the loaded club,
whenever you find them trapped.  But what didst thou do
to thy wolf, O David! when the blood of thy Jonathan was
wet upon thee?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;went for the brute with the butt,&mdash;like mad!&mdash;and
bashed him into jelly."  John shuddered and felt for his
handkerchief and mopped his face and neck.  "He shot at
me&mdash;twice&mdash;and nearly got me, but I&mdash;just bashed on!"
</p>

<p>
"And didst thou sing as thou didst smite?"
</p>

<p>
"They&mdash;they said&mdash;when they got me away, and it took a
lot to hold me!&mdash;they said I talked a gibberish that nobody
could understand."
</p>

<p>
"But I&mdash;possibly&mdash;might have understood it!"  Old Mendel
nodded knowingly and briskly rubbed his hands.  "Well,
well?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, after that I made no bones about killing Germans.
There were nights when I used to creep out of the trench
(nights when there was nothing much doing) with a white
cotton Pierrot's costume I'd picked up pulled over my khaki,
because of the star-shell showing me up dark against the
snow&mdash;and until the enemy got too knowing, I made quite a bag
every week&mdash;of Lonely Fritzes on Advanced Posts.  Fellows
began to look at me rather queerly.  I think I'd got a name
for being a bloodthirsty kind of beast.  And the officers of
my platoon'd say to a man who was noisy and wanting in
caution: 'If you let a cheep out of you, So-and-so, during such
and such an expedition&mdash;I'll tell Hazel to kill you!' and he'd
shut up&mdash;tight as a box."
</p>

<p>
"Aha!"  Mendel hugged himself with his stiff brown sleeves
and chuckled.  "I, Jew of Damascus as I am, do not wonder!&mdash;do
not wonder, knowing the stuff of which thy forefathers
were made!  Now I should depart, for we have talked much,
and the young woman in starched linen is nodding at me and
frowning.  We Jews daily thank the Creator that He did
not make us women: but when there comes pestilence, or War
with wounds and fever, He cannot make too many women
to satisfy us!  Now is there anything more to ask before I
leave you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, I&mdash;Here, hold on for half a mo'!  There is a
question.  If I stick to my guns and don't turn Hebrew, what
becomes of my grandfather's cash?"
</p>

<p>
"Provision in the event you name is duly made in the
Will.  The three hundred and eighty thousand pounds will go
to found an Orthodox Jews University that is to be built
near Jerusalem&mdash;the money being vested in the hands of
certain Trustees.  There are three Trustees.  Lord &mdash;&mdash;, Sir
Arthur &mdash;&mdash; and Professor &mdash;&mdash;" the speaker named three
names of power&mdash;not only in Israel:&mdash;"but you will not let the
money go to found the University.  <i>Shalôm!</i>  Is that not all?"
</p>

<p>
"All&mdash;except that I've not yet asked after my Uncle
Benjamin Simonoff at Hull."
</p>

<p>
"Thy Uncle Benjamin prospers exceedingly.  Trade failed
with Russia when the North Sea Ports were closed; but the
warehouses were full&mdash;and Government paid much money for
tallow, tar, green hides and tanned skins.  Benjamin is
enlisted in a Home Defence Corps, and both his sons are on the
sea, serving in converted Hull trawlers.  They sweep for
mines, set snares for what they call 'tin fish' and seem
content with life....  Woman, I have said that I am departing!
Had I not, it is not seemly for your sex to thrust
themselves into the private talk of men!"
</p>

<p>
"But you've been here already over an hour, and the doctors&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The Ward Sister had swept down on him:
</p>

<p>
"I go, I go! ... Nay, but, look to the boy!  He is
swooning! ... Woe to me! heedless and forgetful of his
weakness....  I thought but of confuting the errors of an
Epicurean&mdash;and lo!  I have injured the child I loved!"
</p>

<p>
John, struggling in the clutches of a return-attack of
breathlessness, propped up high against hard pillows, tried to tell
Old Mendel not to bother, that he, John, was as right as
nine-pence, or would be in the shake of a guinea-pig's tail.  But
the words were lost in suffocating gasps and pantings; from
which, administered by Nurse's skilful hands, the prick of a
subcutaneous injection of morphia presently delivered him....
</p>

<p>
The semi-relapse entailed another fortnight in Hospital: its
tedium infinitely relieved by the fulfilment of John's promise
to swot over the documents and papers in the bag.  Which
contained, besides a pair of well-darned spare socks, and a
clean blue-spotted handkerchief of Mendel's, a bag of brown
peppermint-rock, of the highly-flavoured kind most fondly
associated by John Hazel with the blameless days of infancy.
Alas! that the writer should be bound to the Wheel of Truth
as concerning this young man, so unheroic a hero.  As soon
as he was well enough, he ate it all up.

<p>
Three weeks at a Soldier's Seaside Convalescent Home on
the outskirts of a West Coast Winter resort, intervened
before John's return to Campden Hill Terrace.
</p>

<p>
It had been strange to recognise upon his mother's cheerful,
well-preserved comeliness the strained and sharpened look
that is the stamp of War upon the human countenance.
Maurice&mdash;who was later on to develop into a mechanic-private
in what was then the Royal Flying Corps&mdash;the chrysalis
or pupa-stage of ultimate transformation into a Lieutenant-Pilot&mdash;was
Overseas at an Advance Depot of the A.S.C. and
didn't write punctually.  And the double-fronted millinery
and florist's business in Dove Street was languishing.  Fruit
and flowers were only bought to be sent on to the Wounded
in the Hospitals.  Nobody wanted ravishing hats when the
men the hats were meant to slay were being killed in the
trenches; besides, British women were all agreed by now that
in War-time some kind of uniform was the only possible
wear.  So Lady Delphinia had departed to France to open
a Hostel for Officers at one of the Allied Bases, and the huge
benevolent octopus of Organised Activity had enveloped within
its tentacles Mrs. Hazel and her set.  They spent their days
strenuously at various West End Centres, in making every
imaginable aid,&mdash;from list slippers to body belts, from
artificial legs and arms to life-saving waistcoats&mdash;for the Fleet
and the Forces; and if they took comfort from the knowledge
that their neighbours at the trestle-tables in the crowded
work-rooms were occasionally Duchesses, who shall grudge John's
mother and her intimates the gratification they derived from
this fact!
</p>

<p>
Of the visit of Mendel Bartoth to the Hospital at
Colthill, John said nothing to his mother.  After all, it was
his affair.  His and Maurice's&mdash;because it was provided under
the conditions of the Will of Eli Hazaël that, should the
elder of the two surviving male representatives of his House
decline to adopt the Judaism of his forefathers (and
incidentally forfeit a sum of £380,000), the younger should be
offered the fortune thus foregone.
</p>

<p>
Justice and wisdom went to the making of the Will, with
consideration and magnanimity.  John was to have two years
clear in which to make up his mind.  In the meanwhile, there
was the acceptable sum of £500 to be earned by taking a run
up North as soon as his health was sufficiently restored.
</p>

<p>
Consequently upon a bitter grey-white morning in the
February of 1916, Private John Hazel found himself seated in
a grimy third-class compartment of the Kelso Express, steaming
out of a vast and murky London terminus, upon the
strangest errand of his life.
</p>

<p>
The thing was real.  He might have dreamed old Mendel:
but that there could be no doubt in face of all those proofs.
The typewritten papers and the queer crumbly parchments
were in the brown calfskin bag beside him.  And, queerest of
all, the ring: the intaglio of the bust of Hercules in black onyx
in its ancient setting of pale greenish gold, incredibly battered,
was on the third finger of his big left hand....
</p>

<p>
He squeezed the back sheet of his <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> into a
ball, observant of the inferior quality of the paper&mdash;cleared
away the clammy fog and grime that obscured the window
next him&mdash;and settled down to read the News.
</p>

<p>
Front after front had burst into roaring flame; the brown
shuttle of the Army and the dark blue shuttle of the Navy,
driven back and forth with dizzying rapidity, wove the bloody
web of War upon the loom of Fate daily, hourly, momentarily....
</p>

<p>
Sir Douglas Haig had succeeded Sir John French in command
of our Forces in France in the previous December.  De
Wet and other South Africans had been pardoned.  General
Smuts had been appointed to command in East Africa; the
Germans had been repulsed at Loos, a Zeppelin raid on Paris
had twice been unsuccessfully attempted; the Senussi Arabs
had been beaten in West Egypt, the Kut Relief Force were at
grips with the Turkish forces;&mdash;France was fighting superbly
to hold Vimy Ridge her own.  And the Military Service Bill
was effective in Great Britain; and the final act of the
Evacuation, ringing down the curtain on the unsuccessful tragedy of
the Gallipoli Peninsula was fading from the minds of men....
A bad, bad business! John commented mentally.  He
wished the Blooming Bungler who was responsible for all that
waste of blood and prestige and money could be jammed into
a British trench-mortar of the old-fashioned, big-bellied,
Jumbo pattern&mdash;and biffed&mdash;say 450 yards&mdash;into the Turkish
lines!  And then he fell to staring at the women in blue
overalls not innocent of grease, with the initials of the Railway
Company in braid that was no longer white&mdash;and blue caps
with shiny peaks and white braid badges.  And the other
women who tapped and greased wheels, and rattled along
luggage trucks, and trolleys of lamps and foot-warmers;&mdash;not
forgetting yet other women in dark blue serge uniforms with
bright steel buttons, who had clipped his ticket for Scotland
when he passed the Barrier.
</p>

<p>
For London was astonishingly altered by the War.  Not
only by the temporary War Constructions, the Specials, and
the sand-bagging and wire-netting of public and private
buildings: not only by glassless windows&mdash;shattered walls and
holes in the concrete pavement,&mdash;wounds torn by High
Explosive bombs dropped by Zeppelins and Gothas on the grey
breast of the City, that in John Hazel's estimation was built
about the hub of the world.  The most remarkable of all the
War-changes was in the women.  In Belgium and France the
women young and old had done men's work, and sometimes
looked as though they enjoyed doing it.  Somehow one
expected it of Continental womanhood.  But that British
womanhood should conduct trams and omnibuses in dark grey
jackets with black leather buttons and belts, short skirts to
suit, and black leather gaiters, slouch hats or shiny-peaked
caps,&mdash;intrigued John Hazel wonderfully.  A young woman
had driven him to King's Cross from Campden Hill, smart
and business-like in a yellow oilskin coat, peaked yellow
oilskin cap&mdash;<i>toujours</i> the peaked cap&mdash;big leathern gauntlet-gloves,
strap-satchel and general air of confident competency....
She had not overcharged: and had thrust back John's
proffered <i>douceur</i> with the succinct statement: "We don't take
tips from soldiers, <i>these</i> days!"
</p>

<p>
And whizzed smoothly out of John Hazel's ken, leaving the
young man standing staring after her, with the calfskin bag
in one hand and a suit-case in the other; amidst the very
audible smiles of the lady-porters and luggage-clerks.
</p>

<p>
The door of the compartment opened at this juncture,
admitting a drab-faced elderly woman in greasy blue overalls.
With a grimy duster she flapped the seats of the comfortless
third-class, raising a cloud of cindery dust that made the sole
passenger sneeze; whisked a collection of orange-peel,
nut-shells, toffee-papers and "Puss-Puss!" and "Woodbine" cigarette
wrappers under the opposite seat, and fell out again over
John Hazel's boots, leaving the atmosphere murkier than
ever.
</p>

<p>
Fear&mdash;the acquired fear of encountering the glare of a
Sergeant, or the chilly stare of the wearer of a Sam Browne,
had hitherto arrested the hand of the Junior Partner in the
thriving Cornhill firm of Dannahill, Lee-Levyson and Hazel,
Insurance-brokers,&mdash;when it would fain have placed on the
rubber pad of the Booking Office pigeon-hole, the fare for a
First Class Return.
</p>

<p>
But now, the prospect of a run of some three hundred and
fifty odd miles North in captivity so grim, chilly and
unsavoury, prompted a young man with muscles still soft from
confinement to a Hospital bed, and the kindly coddling of
Hospital Sisters,&mdash;and with the warning of the C.M.O. with
regard to avoidance of bronchitis still fresh in mind,&mdash;to
extract a soiled ten-shilling note or "pinky" from a pigskin
wallet; to project the upper half of his big body from the
carriage-window, and endeavour, not unsuccessfully, to catch the eye
of the guard.
</p>

<p>
"Na, na, nae Second Class.  Ye'll have hearrd that ava' at
the Booking Office!"
</p>

<p>
The silver-braided functionary, checked momentarily in his
stride by the appeal of an agitated old lady, presented his
highly-dried and sandily-bearded countenance upon a level
with the buttons of John's front tunic-pockets, and inclined
a freckled ear to the young man's appeal.  The answer came
in the droning chant of Berwick:
</p>

<p>
"Ye can pay the differ between the firr'st an' third-class&mdash;I'm
no' for stopping ye.  Though, ye ken, wi' ilka officer that
gets in, ye'll rin the same risk!"
</p>

<p>
"Of being turned out with a flea in my ear, you mean,"
returned John Hazel, not unobservant of the mahogany <i>reflet</i>
of certain Sam Brownes, isolated or in knots, upon the
platform, in juxtaposition with open carriage-doors, or mingling
with the scanty groups of would-be passengers under the
arc-lights (camouflaged with blue paint) that cast false pallor on
the freshest cheek, and made sickly faces masks of Death; and
threw long purplish shadows of people and things (at angles
suggestive of Futurist Art) upon the greasy asphalte of the
Northern terminus....
</p>

<p>
"O, ay!  If ye're willin' to tak the risk...."
</p>

<p>
The glitter of a certain medal on the Private's breast, and
the shine of two parallel strips of gold braid upon his cuff,
had caught the sharp grey eyes of the guard.  He thrust back
the offered note on the confounded John, leaped at his suitcase
and tore it from the rack, and shepherded his huge charge
through the clank and rattle and roll of luggage trucks,
foot-warmer barrows, and lamp-trolleys, shouting:
</p>

<p>
"Come awa' wi' you, man!&mdash;there's a firr'st weel forward,
wi' a twa&mdash;three women-bodies that would gie guid skelps to
the officer that daured look crookit at ony Tommy&mdash;forbye
a lang black lad wi' the D.C.M.!"
</p>

<p>
Thus John Hazel, suffering for once from an acute attack
of bashfulness, found himself installed in a corner of a
fairly-warmed if faintly-lighted first-class compartment,
containing in addition to many cloaks, rugs, pillows, tea-baskets,
and other cosy accompaniments of travel,&mdash;three ladies of
uncertain ages, but very definite position in life,&mdash;also a Young
Person of highly-coloured exotic charms, clamorously
perfumed; whose crimson hair was surmounted by a French
officer's tasselled <i>képi</i>, and who displayed, below marvellously
abbreviated skirts, silk stockings of open trellis-work, ending
in such boots of yellow leather with tinsel cross-laces as are
commonly associated with Principal Boys in Pantomime....
</p>

<p>
Of the three ladies, two carried the dark blue uniform of
a Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross Society
and held officers' rank of sorts, for both were pipped.  While
the third, an incredibly tall, thin woman, with eyebrows arched
and black as musical slurs, pale greenish-gold hair, a white,
triangular face, and a V-shaped mouth as scarlet as a Pierrot's,
wore upon her khaki sleeve the brassard of the Liberal
Ladies' War Service Legion, with the lapel, shoulder and
hat-badges distinctive of a Commandant.
</p>

<p>
All three displayed the roughened hands and damaged
finger-nails characteristic of British womanhood at this
strenuous period.  Theirs was the unabashed and frank
regard, born of the calm self-confidence which springs&mdash;not from
the conviction, but from the established fact of being Somebody
in Society.  All three were loud of voice, long of limb,
easy if abrupt of movement: prone to discuss their own and
their friends' private affairs in the presence of strangers; as
though the man or woman in the corner, palpably an alien
from Their Set, must in consequence be deaf and dumb.
</p>

<p>
"Howling swells!" was John Hazel's pithy mental comment,
recognising upon three of his fellow-travellers the
unmistakable cachet of Good Society.  "The Mums," he reflected,
rather wistfully&mdash;one of the Nice Things about John was his
belief in his mother&mdash;"the Mums would be in her element
here!"  And he leaned luxuriously back upon a plump cushion
that one of the V.A.D. ladies had deftly thrust behind him,
in the corner that had been unostentatiously vacated when
the big young man, with hollow black eyes and prominent
cheek-bones, and khaki baggily hanging upon a huge frame
wasted by hæmorrhage and strict dietary, had heaved in sight.
And the Commandant handed him the day's issue of an
expensive <i>Illustrated Society</i>; saying, with a characteristic
emphasis suggestive of large capitals:
</p>

<p>
"Of course, I really don't believe you'll Cotton Much to
this, but it may get you over an hour!  Pass it on to
somebody else when you've done&mdash;I Don't want it back!"
</p>

<p>
She nodded smilingly in acknowledgment of Hazel's gratitude,
and the young person in the gilt-tasselled French <i>képi</i>
followed suit by giving John the current number of "<i>Frillies</i>,"
a purely feminine publication&mdash;devoted to the puffing of silk
pyjamas and embroidered underwear, with Piffel Pearls
(warranted to outshine real ones) and Face Creams guaranteed
to remove Complexion Blemishes contracted at Munition
Factories, or in Labour on the Land....
</p>

<p>
Then she suddenly saw a friend, seized her handbag and
suit-case, and departed on the corridor-side of the compartment
in a gale of violent perfume.  John opened the sliding-door,
shut the same on her departure; pulled up his rug and
began to sip the honeyed sweetness of "Loveliness in Lingerie,"
and the three ladies, as the savage tang of verbena died upon
the air, unleashed their loud, high voices apparently upon the
trail of some subject mooted before.
</p>

<p>
"You have heard that Evelyn Graynger has consoled herself?"
asked the startlingly thin woman in khaki, lifting her
musical slurs of eyebrows towards the peak of her badged
cap, from the back of which a short square veil depended,
and momentarily glancing as she did this, at a three-inch band
of black crape upon her left arm.  "Though I am quite sure
that the poor child <i>really</i> did care for my poor Wastwood
and my poor Jerry&mdash;you know she became engaged to Jerry
not long after Wastwood&mdash;"  She blinked and broke off.
</p>

<p>
"Really! ..." the dark blue ladies chorused; and the elder
exclaimed sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"How awfully difficult it must have made their mother's
position!  Didn't it, Trixie dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Now Evelyn is going, I hear, to marry the popular Anglican
preacher, Mr. Amice-Bellows," continued the khaki Commandant.
"He likes to be called 'Father,' don't you know!&mdash;and
has still a great many wealthy lady-penitents; never having
felt any irresistible call to volunteer as a Chaplain
accompanying Forces to the Front.  He opens Soldiers' Refreshment
Buffets with prayer, and figures on Red Cross Bazaar
Committees, and visits wounded Tommies in Hospital and all that,
and of course there must be people to do these things....
And they say he has a consoling manner with his clients&mdash;I
should say Congregation&mdash;when they're knocked out by Bad
News!  Though I remember when the second bomb dropped,&mdash;I
mean in the shape of another wire from the Casualty
Department of the War Office&mdash;and I was rather off colour
in consequence&mdash;he advised me to drink a pint of hot water
regularly every morning with Bi&mdash;something-of-something-or-other
stirred in."
</p>

<p>
The two V.A.D. ladies shrieked.  The triangular-faced
Commandant in khaki continued, all unconscious that the
illustrated periodical bestowed on John Hazel displayed her
photograph, with the appended description:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Trixie, Lady Wastwood.  Mother of the late, and aunt of
the present Earl.  Who has been doing splendid service as
a Commandant of the Liberal Ladies' War Service Legion
at one of our principal Bases in France, in adherence to
the well-known motto of the Legion: <i>Do Anything, Go
Anywhere, Stick at Nothing, and Never Grouse</i>!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Well-meant"&mdash;the elder of the two blue women was speaking
through her laughter, "but hardly tactful of Mr. Amice
Bellows&mdash;to suggest that biliousness and bereavement produce
symptoms practically the same!"
</p>

<p>
"Anyhow," the khaki woman's laugh rattled out as though
a stick had been drawn over the keys of a piano, "I took
the parson's counsel&mdash;vicariously.  Went down every day
to Waterloo Station and poured tea and coffee into thirsty
Tommies at a Soldiers' Free Refreshment Buffet&mdash;instead of
irrigating myself.  Found it swamped the blue devils quite
as effectually.  And"&mdash;she touched her khaki lightly&mdash;"that's
how this&mdash;began.  Same with both of you&mdash;I rather
fancy?" ...
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I entered as Probationer at St. Francis and St. Clara's
after the Third Reserve Battalion of the Loyal North
Linkshires got gassed at Ypres last Spring," said the younger of
the V.A.D. women, who had also a mourning armlet, and
could not have been older than twenty-two or three.  "And I
found scrubbing floors and carrying buckets better&mdash;oh!&mdash;miles
better than all the veronal in all the chemists' shops."
</p>

<p>
"I agree with Cynthia," said the other blue lady, "I think
the V.A.D. was meant to keep the women who have lost
their all from lying down and dying&mdash;or running <i>amok</i>.  Hark!
Was that a Take Cover?" ...
</p>

<p>
A detonation in the distance had been followed by a wailing
hoot of peculiar ugliness.  Silence descended upon the Terminus.
Most of the faces that turned to each other in inquiry,
seemed to have suddenly been powdered white.  The three
women in John's carriage betrayed no emotion.  They waited
in silence, but no second detonation followed.  And John Hazel
said as his gaunt black eyes, met Lady Wastwood's, that were
green and singularly brilliant:
</p>

<p>
"I think the tyre of a motor-'bus burst&mdash;just before they
sounded the dinner-hooter at some near-by factory.  I know
Longmore's Locust Bean chocolate used to be turned out at a
place close here."
</p>

<p>
All three women nodded and smiled in recognition of the
soldier's civility.  The hollows about his eyes, and under his
cheek-bones, the bagginess of his khaki&mdash;in favour of which
he had gratefully abandoned the suit of Reckitt's Blue flannel
with white lapels, and the scarlet cotton necktie of Hospital
wear, had&mdash;in combination with the medal and the
wound-stripes, won him favour in their eyes....
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood gave him another paper, a <i>Morning Post</i>,
and the younger of the V.A.D.'s was following suit with a
packet of chocolate, when the first starting-gong clangalanged,&mdash;the
carriage-door was wrenched open, and a tall thin officer,
followed by a porter carrying a Gladstone bag and tartan
rug, was in the very act of entering when he encountered
Lady Wastwood's glance....
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0208"></a></p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
Private Hazel had fainted in spirit at the sight of a Brass
Hat, a double row of multi-coloured ribbons, and the badges
of a Lieutenant-Colonel; and his ears had already begun to
tingle with the expectation of official rebuke&mdash;when the officer,
arrested in the stride of entrance on the brass-bound threshold
of the Railway Company&mdash;reddened and paled as he saluted.
His singularly unhappy grey eyes had met the eyes of Lady
Wastwood.  Freezing as green Arctic icicles, they held those
of the victim in a hostile and repellent stare.  Her mouth,
devoid of its V-shaped Pierrot smile&mdash;straightened to a frigid
line of sheerest disapproval.  Her chin combined with the
mouth and the eyes, in the admission that somewhere between
sickened Earth and revolted Heaven a wretch like this dared
to draw breath....
</p>

<p>
The situation lasted one intolerable moment, its poignancy
even penetrating John Hazel's pachydermatous hide.  He
found himself wincing in sympathy with the sufferer, whose
lashed blood rose darkly under his clear nut-brown skin.  Still,
not a muscle twitched to betray him.  His deep-set eyes
ranged from face to face of the occupants of the carriage,
searching for one gleam of sympathy, possibly.  His mouth
opened as though he would have spoken, then shut; and his
face became as a granite mask.  He saluted again formally,
backed out, lightly jumped from the step, carefully shut the
carriage-door, and walked away down the platform, the laden
porter at his heels, as the two V.A.D. women exclaimed in
shocked accents:
</p>

<p>
"How <i>could</i> you? ... Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"What <i>rows</i> of decorations!"
</p>

<p>
"And, <i>my dear</i>!&mdash;what can the man have done to deserve a
cut like that?"
</p>

<p>
They of the High Caste paid no heed to John, ambushed
behind the current issue of <i>Frillies</i>, with both ears cocked for
the name of the protagonist....
</p>

<p>
"It is Edward Yaill," said Lady Wastwood, as though prefix
and patronymic offended the palate, and blistered the reluctant
organ of speech.  "Colonel Edward Yaill.  Of the &mdash;th Tweedburgh
Regiment."
</p>

<p>
The younger of the V.A.D. ladies exclaimed, as though
in pain for him:
</p>

<p>
"<i>The</i> Colonel Yaill! ... That brave, unlucky man!"
</p>

<p>
"And your County neighbour!"  This from the elder blue
lady, to whom Lady Wastwood returned:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, when I happen to be in Scotland.  But I so seldom
am at Whingates now.  However, since poor Jerry's successor
made a point of my looking up his womanhood, I promised
to run up there next time I felt washed out.  Colonel Yaill
was my fellow-passenger on the Boat for Boulogne one day
last March....  Now again we encounter&mdash;rather
unfortunately for him!"
</p>

<p>
"Do, do forgive him, next time you tumble against him!"
begged Yaill's previous champion.
</p>

<p>
"Edward Yaill has had a sample," said Lady Wastwood
icily, "of what he may expect from me in the near as in the
distant future.  Let us hope he will be wiser than to rush
upon his doom.  What wouldn't I have given to possess the
Early Victorian stare of my old great-aunt, the Duchess of
Strome.  <i>She</i> could cut&mdash;until you saw the blood!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, it was quite bad enough!" the elder V.A.D. assured
her.  "Mercy!  I can't forget his wretched, <i>wretched</i>
eyes!  I do hope I'm not going to dream of them!  There
must be something to be said for a man who looks like
that!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The drab-grey terminus was sliding away....  The clank
of milk-churns and trolley-wheels grew fainter....  A signal
jerked down, with a wink of a red-green eye, the points clicked
over, and the Express was launched upon her shining way
across a tangle of intersecting metals terminated by grim black
signal boxes, and gathering speed,&mdash;shot out of the jaws of a
Goods Station into the foggy day.  And stations were flying
past, and the crowded drab streets of mean houses were flowing
under the belly of the rushing Express like a river of dirty
bricks and mortar,&mdash;and the ladies were moving and settling
down, amongst rugs, cloaks, pillows, tea-baskets and other
accompaniments of feminine travel; hugely amused by the
temporary return to the prehistoric joggliness and stuffy safety
of trains.  And Lady Wastwood had mentioned that she had
had two cars crumped by German H.E. in France&mdash;and it
had transpired that the elder V.A.D. had had hers badly
biffed in September outside a Theatre in the Strand when a
Zepp dropped a bomb quite near,&mdash;and that the younger had
hers temporarily put out of action through tyre wear, taking
convalescent Tommies for drives&mdash;when Lady Wastwood suddenly
betrayed the tenor of her thoughts by remarking with
emphasis:
</p>

<p>
"After all, if there IS anything to be said for Edward Yaill,
Katharine Forbis will be the first to say it!"
</p>

<p>
The uttered name plucked at some fibre in John Hazel's
brain.  He dropped <i>Frillies</i>, and one of the blue ladies reached
down a long arm, and picked the paper up, and gave it back
to him, with the manner of one well-used to doing these
things for sick men.  But she looked at Lady Wastwood, not
at John, as she did this, saying:
</p>

<p>
"'Katharine Forbis.' ... You must mean the handsome
Miss Forbis who went out to the Front to drive ambulance-cars
for her Detachment, some time in last March,&mdash;and was
afterwards invalided home.  Miss Forbis of Kerr's Something&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Kerr's Arbour, Tweedburgh.  A quite modern house built
against a dear old Border Peel Tower.  Twenty miles from
us at Whingates.  Not as the crow flies, but as the
woodcock....  That was my poor Jerry's annual joke.  He hadn't
a shadow of humour, bless his heart!"
</p>

<p>
With which pronouncement John perfectly agreed.  He
had been electrified into attention by a sentence of the previous
speaker's, and was tinglingly alert for another reference to a
name by now uncannily familiar....  "Forbis of Kerr's
Arbour, Tweedburgh" seemed to have plucked at a fibre in his
brain.  He was made to gnash metaphorical teeth by one or
two divagations from the main point, before Forbis cropped
up once more.  Then came another mental jerk with an
utterance from Lady Wastwood:
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact, Edward Yaill and Kathy Forbis had
been engaged quite for ages.  You understand, I was a County
Neighbour then, and saw what was going on.  Edward Yaill's
Infantry Regiment&mdash;'The Tweedburgh Foot-Sloggers' they call
themselves&mdash;there aren't many of the poor dears left to
answer to the old name!&mdash;Edward's Regiment distinguished
itself equally in the Boer War of 1900.  And Edward&mdash;with
his Majority and a D.S.O.&mdash;came back after the War to be
made a great deal of&mdash;and Kathy&mdash;then a quite beautiful girl
of seventeen&mdash;vows that she fell in love with him then and
there.  But the engagement didn't come off until years
later&mdash;and has been dragging on since in a most annoying way.
Kathy&mdash;one of those Fine People who make sacrifices for
others&mdash;didn't want to leave her father, a courtly old dear with
a beautiful manner! after her mother&mdash;a Sweet Creature!&mdash;died.
So the wedding was continually postponed.  The last
date arranged being the October of 1914."
</p>

<p>
Both the V.A.D. ladies uttered sounds of sympathy; and
Lady Wastwood went on, while, thanks to the oil-smooth
running of the Express,&mdash;and perceptions sharpened by War's
savage exigencies&mdash;John Hazel, ambushed behind the ample
pages of the feminine periodical&mdash;followed the trend of the
high-voiced narrative as easily as though he had been sitting
in the stalls at a new play....
</p>

<p>
"In that August&mdash;Edward was then staying at Kerr's
Arbour,&mdash;came the Bolt from the Blue! ... With the &mdash;th
Brigade of the &mdash;th Division of our First British Expeditionary,
goes Yaill, then Senior Major of the First Battalion of 'The
Tweedburghs' ... Katharine's pride in him was touching.
She said very little, I remember, but her eyes&mdash;do you
remember her wonderful eyes?"
</p>

<p>
One of the V.A.D.'s agreed:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, oh, yes!  Quite wonderfully beautiful eyes!"
</p>

<p>
"'Gold and bramble-dew,' to quote Robert Louis Stevenson's
celebrated simile.  His wife, to whom reference was made, I
believe&mdash;was a Scotswoman though American-bred.  But to
go back to Edward&mdash;then Major Yaill,&mdash;you will remember&mdash;who
does not? that at Le Cateau-Cambresis that August his
Battalion underwent an Ordeal of Fire.  So terrible, that
Major Yaill and two junior officers, with a handful of men
alone remained.  Wounded, his uniform burned to rags&mdash;they
say he fought like a god or a devil!&mdash;he escaped being taken
by the Boches.  But all the world knows the splendid story.
I'm making myself a Perfect Bore!"
</p>

<p>
The V.A.D.'s assured her she wasn't in the least; and she
went on volubly talking, above the oily purring of the Kelso
Express.
</p>

<p>
"Escaped, and wandered, starving, wounded and in tatters;
hiding in farmyards and amongst ruins by day,&mdash;and tramping,
guided only by his luminous compass&mdash;at night-time.  Fed
by Walloon and Belgian peasants who were too scared&mdash;poor
Things! one well knows why!&mdash;to give him even a few hours'
shelter.  Five days and nights, and he reached the Belgian
frontier&mdash;passed the guard unnoticed&mdash;and got upon the
Flushing Boat.  And if you suppose that Kathy Forbis fainted
when she had his wire, or even Cried for Joy all over
everybody, you'd be Wrong.  Absolutely!"
</p>

<p>
John knew you would have been wrong.  Under cover of
<i>Tailor-Made Talks</i> he nodded his head, with a kind of
proprietorial pride in Katharine Forbis.
</p>

<p>
"What did she do?" asked one of the blue women.
</p>

<p>
"She simply said 'Thank God!' and went on with her First
Aid bandaging.  Then&mdash;after some delay because of Dutch
Neutrality&mdash;Edward Yaill managed to get out of Holland
and came back home."
</p>

<p>
"Rather a wreck, one supposes?" hazarded a V.A.D.
</p>

<p>
"Haggard and worn," admitted Lady Wastwood.  "With
those hollows in the temples one knows so well, and that queer
tense, sleepless look they can't get rid of.  One would
naturally have expected that He and Katharine would have been
Married Instantly.  But I have absolute knowledge, that the
subject was Never Broached!"
</p>

<p>
"Rough on Miss Forbis, rather!" hazarded one of the
hearers.  To whom Lady Wastwood retorted:
</p>

<p>
"Fortunately for Miss Forbis&mdash;as things have now developed!
But that she would have jumped with Joy had Edward
breathed a hint of marriage&mdash;Nobody could doubt who saw her
look at him....  Sweetheart and wife and mother, mingled
in her expression.  'She makes me want to cry!' said that Old
Rip Delaguett.  And he meant the thing....  It's odd how
those Bad Men adore Pure Women.  Let us do Delaguett
justice&mdash;he <i>swore</i> she was too good for Yaill!"
</p>

<p>
"Did <i>he</i> agree with Lord Delaguett?" asked one of the blue
ladies.
</p>

<p>
"If he had," returned Lady Wastwood, "Kathy would have
disagreed.  And one task absorbed him, body and soul.  Assisting
the Authorities to reconstitute the Battalion that had been
wiped out.  This was done, and he was offered the post of
Second Military Secretary to Sir Charles Carberry at
Gibraltar.  Wouldn't you have expected him to take the goods the
gods provided, marry his Nice Katharine, and sail for the
Rock?  Kathy would have risked tin fish in shoals!&mdash;and a
nuptial couch at the bottom of the Atlantic or the
Mediterranean.  But&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"But Edward Yaill wouldn't hear of such a thing!  Took the
post&mdash;went out&mdash;absolutely fed&mdash;simply hated it!  Groused
away at G.H.Q. until they gave him what he wanted most."
</p>

<p>
"One can guess what that was!"
</p>

<p>
"Naturally.  Command of the new old Tweedburgh Regiment,
and Active Service in France again.  'To get back
just a bit on account from those blighters!' he told me: 'I'd
take over a Territorial Regiment from Hell.  And to lead
one's own Border men again is too&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Absolutely topping!" suggested Yaill's original champion.
</p>

<p>
"You have the expression.  Well, one perished to <i>trancher
le mot</i>, but in view of Katharine's splendid attitude&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Backed him for all she was worth, I'll bet!" said John
Hazel internally.
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood's high voice went on, through the Express's
oily running:
</p>

<p>
"Calm, hopeful and encouraging beyond all&mdash;one couldn't
have ventured to say a Thing!  On one point she was
adamant&mdash;She would do her bit like others.  Home Service wasn't
enough&mdash;you comprehend!&mdash;for Kathy Forbis.  She had got
her First Class Certificate and Qualifications&mdash;and went to
the Front, dear sweet thing! early in March, 1915, to drive
cars for the Red Cross."
</p>

<p>
"And so Colonel Yaill&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Went out again to take over command of his Regiment,
Colonel Muir-Rosyll, an old friend of mine&mdash;having gone
West.  And just as though Fate had been lying in wait for
Edward!&mdash;in September&mdash;somewhere South of Loos&mdash;the
Horror Happened Again!"
</p>

<p>
"The 'Tweedburghs' were wiped out in the assault upon the
village! ... Oh! one remembers...."
</p>

<p>
The elder of the blue ladies shuddered, the younger bit her
lip.
</p>

<p>
"Swept away....  'Exterminated'&mdash;that's what the newspapers
called it.  And Edward Yaill's name was on the early
list of killed.  It seems that he had gone out from Battalion
Staff Headquarters&mdash;all his officers but two being dead&mdash;to
take over Telephone-Communication at their Forward Station
Dug-out, and got there in time for a terrific bombardment of
High Velocity Shell."
</p>

<p>
"What unutterably Awful luck!  Was he very badly
wounded?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardly a scratch on him, when they found him&mdash;one has
heard so much of the queer fantastic tricks that High
Explosive plays.  Nearly naked and covered with yellow powder.
Quite Dazed&mdash;not a notion of his own identity!  Which of
course was established by a gold curb wrist-chain with an
Identification Disc, and an officer's silver whistle with his
name upon it still hanging round his Neck&mdash;when they took
him to a General Casualty Hospital on the Communication
Lines.  Where the Poor Thing was treated with scores of
other Shell Shock cases, until he came round enough to
remember his rank and name."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't Miss Forbis wring out leave and rush from the
Front to comfort him?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Katharine was badly wanted just then, where she
was, at her Receiving Hospital.  And personal interests must
give place when Duty is in question.  I imagine that we're
all of us pretty clear on that!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood added, as confirmatory sounds came from
both her feminine hearers:
</p>

<p>
"There's no question but her going to him would have
saved Yaill.  But unhappily, it was not to be.  Nice
Katharine&mdash;poor dear!&mdash;was invalided home from the Western
Front a month later.  Muscular strain, lifting wounded
Tommies under Fire.  Had to come back for Massage and
Electrical Treatment.  While Edward Yaill, who had been
transferred to a Convalescent British Officers Canvas Camp at the
B&mdash;&mdash; Base (up-to-date place under Red Cross Management,
with pines and heather and bracken, and little streams gurgling
down steep sandy cliffs)&mdash;Edward had been making steady
progress towards complete recovery.  Until&mdash;not quite a
fortnight back&mdash;he Socially Cut His Throat!"
</p>

<p>
The ladies exclaimed.  The narrator continued:
</p>

<p>
"Cut his throat by suddenly marrying a Trained Nurse
belonging to a Unit of the Red Cross, doing duty at the
B&mdash;&mdash; Base C.O.C....  Having obtained the necessary
permit from his Brigadier.  Whether the young woman got
leave from the Matron-in-Chief on the West Front, or did
without it, I couldn't tell you!  I think the latter, as she
had previously sent in her papers asking leave to retire for
reasons of health.  At any rate, the ceremony was
performed by the Church-of-England Chaplain attached to the
C.O.C."
</p>

<p>
The narrator added, raising her arched eyebrows:
"Quite legal, of course, but one Would have expected the
thing to have been clinched by a Roman Catholic Priest.
Yaill being R.C. like Poor Dear Katherine&mdash;to whom, one
hopes, her Religion,&mdash;always so Much to her&mdash;may bring
True Courage to Bear the Blow!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood added, through her listeners' horrified
exclamations:
</p>

<p>
"Subsequently to the wedding the couple sailed for
England, all arrangements having been Cleverly Camouflaged....
Nobody seems to have realised what had happened....  My
own enlightenment was to come from Our London Headquarters,
where I reported myself yesterday.  A Wireless
Message had been Received by Our Deputy Assistant Director-General
from the Matron-in-chief on the Western Front in
France.  Our D.A.D.G. happens to be Colonel Yaill's cousin.
That's how the item of news got dropped in.  And subsequently
she 'phoned me in Code at my Mayfair diggings&mdash;to
say that her Sister-in-law, Lady Ridgely,&mdash;Red Cross
Commandant of a Tommies' Convalescent Hospital at Coombe
Bay, Devon&mdash;had encountered Colonel and Mrs. Yaill, upon
their honeymoon."
</p>

<p>
The elder V.A.D. lady moaned despairingly:
</p>

<p>
"And now he tumbles in on us here&mdash;a passenger going
North....  How can he?  Why, why set foot in Scotland,
of all places on the globe?"
</p>

<p>
The newspaper rustled in a pair of big bony hands, that
were shaking with rage as though with ague.  There was a
roaring in John Hazel's ears....  Spots of red, ringed with
paler colour, grew and dimmed and faded out upon the page
before him.  If the harmless periodical had slipped from his
hold, the sight of the mask of murder it had screened might
have led to the pulling of the communication-cord and the
subsequent appearance of the guard.  For the man was not
the same man who had shed the black frock coat and silk
topper of Cornhill in the September of 1914.  He had spilled
blood since then, for duty's sake, and for revenge; and found
sharp pleasure in the shedding.  And much, very much, he
wanted to kill Edward Yaill.  But Lady Wastwood was
answering the two blue ladies:
</p>

<p>
"That is what I ask myself.  Why? and How Can he? ... Unless,
indeed, he were going up North to tell&mdash;to break the
news to Katharine!  Or does he possess sufficient Nerve to
attend the Funeral?"  She added, meeting the ladies'
uncomprehending eyes: "Perhaps you have somehow missed the
advertisement in Wednesday's <i>Morning Wire</i>!  Heading the
List of Deaths....  'General Sir Philip Forbis, K.C.B.' and
so on....  'Result of accident....  No Flowers, By
Request.' (He hated paraphernalia!) ... 'R.I.P.'" ...
</p>

<p>
Under cover of the ladies' sympathetic exclamations, John
secured the front page of the <i>Morning Wire</i> without any
results.  But the "Obituary Notices" in the <i>Illustrated Society</i>
of that morning's issue supplied him in full with the
intelligence he desired....
</p>

<p>
At Kerr's Arbour, Tweedburgh, N.B., had died on the
previous Saturday, the man John was going up North to meet.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"A notable figure in Society and oldest living representative
of one of the most ancient Catholic families upon the
Border," stated the chronicler, "has now passed away in the
person of Major-General Sir Philip Forbis, K.C.B., C.M.G., etc.
Born at Kerr's Arbour, Tweedburgh, 1834, the seat of his
family for sixteen generations.  Married Muriel Helen
(d. 1910), dau. of C. Colleston, Esq., J. P., of Wyond Hall,
Norfolk.  Edu. R.M.A. Woolwich.  Entered Royal Horse
Artillery 1852.  Col. 1882, retired as Hon. Maj. Gen. 1884.
Served in Crimean Campaign 1854-7.  Wounded eight times.
Medal, clasp and Turkish Medal.  Prepared five contingents
for the War in South Africa.  Upon the outbreak of War
with Germany in 1914 Major-General Forbis, having kept
abreast of modern military progress, raised and trained a
Yeomanry Regiment of Light Cavalry for Kitchener's New
Army, three squadrons of which are now serving with distinction
in France.  The deceased officer met his death, as perhaps
he would have chosen,&mdash;while leading a charge of the
Fourth and Fifth Squadrons, on the Cauldstanes Muirlees
Racecourse, ceded by the Local Racing Committee to
Government as a Military Exercise Ground."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
John thought the Major General deceased must have been a
jolly fine old fellow.  Mentally picturing him as lightly-built,
active, wiry and upright, with a keen light blue eye, crisp
white hair and close-clipped white moustache, giving the
brusque touch of soldierly decision to an aquiline-featured face
of many criss-cross wrinkles.  He added a peppery temper
when put out, and a light hand on a bridle, before he proceeded
to the paragraph below:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"General Forbis' elder son, Captain Mark Forbis of the
'Gray Hussars,' went out with the First British
Expeditionary Army in August, 1914, and was killed before Mons,
while rendering a service for which he was posthumously
awarded the Victoria Cross.  The second son, the Rev. Father
Julian Forbis, of the Order of St. Gerard (now head
of the family), has served with distinction as a Chaplain
with the Mediterranean Forces recently withdrawn from
Gallipoli.  Miss Forbis, V.A.D., has rendered excellent service
in France as an Ambulance Driver for the Red Cross
Society.  She has fortunately recovered from the muscular
strain, for the treatment of which she was invalided home
some months previously; and pending her return to more
active duties, has been assisting the overworked Nursing
Staff at Cauldstanes County Hospital."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A paragraph below continued:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The origin of the name of 'Kerr's Arbour,' which has
always distinguished the ancient mansion dignified by the
massive peel-tower (built by a certain Sir Hew Forbis in 1147
and which has been for nearly nine hundred years the seat
of the Forbis' family), is lost in the mists of antiquity.  Owing
to the loss of some ancient documents, the Scottish Herald's
College and collateral authorities can throw but little light
upon the question, when broached.  The Forbis coat of
arms consists of a shield with three escallops <i>argent</i> on a
<i>fesse</i> between two chevrons <i>sable</i> and <i>gules</i>, with the crest
of a wolf's head and the motto: 'FORBYS FOES FA.'  But
that the original founder of the Forbis family was a Roman
tribune named Marcus Fabius, who, reared in Egypt by a
Community of Coptic monks, brought his Christian faith
with his sword to Britain, in the service of the Emperor
Constantius, seems to be generally agreed."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
John wondered how the bigwigs at the Scottish Herald's
College would like a dip into the contents of that calfskin
bag of Old Mendel's.  Stowed well within touch of elbow,
beside him on the seat, it struck him as wearing a
consciously-secretive air.  For the bag knew all about the antecedents of
the Forbis's (going back a whole generation before Marcus
F.).  It could have told how the Crusader Sir Hew Forbis
(whom John would have liked to kick for a family reason)&mdash;built
the Tower:&mdash;and where the bags of French gold came
from that paid the architect and the workmen, and quarried
the stone, and "bocht ye lyme an ye clypins of a troop of ye
Scots Kyng's Horsys ye betyr for to bynd ye same." ... And
why Sir Hew called the place Kir Saba,&mdash;transmogrified in the
course of centuries to quite another name.
</p>

<p>
But on these points Scottish Herald's College must perforce
remain in ignorance, unless Katharine Forbis&mdash;of Kerr's
Arbour&mdash;who had driven a Car for the Red Cross in France,
and had got somehow hurt in lifting wounded Tommies,&mdash;and
had eyes of "gold and bramble-dew"&mdash;John Hazel was mightily
taken with that simile of Stevenson's&mdash;unless Katharine Forbis
should consent to share the secrets of the calfskin bag....
</p>

<p>
Katharine Forbis, the Ideal Woman....  Devoid as John
was of any knowledge of her personality, the vague outlines
supplied by the gossip of his fellow passengers adapted
themselves quite wonderfully to the image stamped upon his mental
retina one April day in Flanders on the grim road that led
from the British Reserve Trenches to the Firing Line.  Had he
received that post-card&mdash;and it must have been sent, for She
had promised&mdash;would it have been signed with the initials
K.F.?
</p>

<p>
Katharine Forbis....  Katharine Forbis.  What luck if this
Katharine were She?  He leaned back and shut his tired eyes,
and fell to dreaming of this Katharine: a Princess of the North
with cairngorm eyes; to whose court was momentarily drawing
nearer&mdash;out of the Orient from whence all Mystery springs&mdash;a
swarthy legate,&mdash;bringing neither apes nor parrots, embroideries
or spices,&mdash;but the rare jewel of an ancient oath of fealty,
unbroken by the use and wear of more than sixteen hundred
years.

IX
</h3>

<p>
Certain passengers travelling by the Kelso Express were
presently switched off on a Branch Line, to rumble for a chilly
hour in unwarmed and feebly-lighted carriages, between
low-breasting heathery hills patched with larch and oak-woods,
shagged with gorse and delicately topped with snow.  Upon
the left hand, beyond the blue-green riband of a river narrowing
between its encroaching icy borders; lying between low sandstone
cliffs hollowed by spates from the hills, the last embers
of a fierce red sunset were smouldering away....
</p>

<p>
Signs of the Day were apparent, in the significant age or
suggestive youth of the plaided shepherds who moved as isolated
dots upon the cheerless landscape; their collies bounding
at their heels, or harrying flocks of black-faced sheep back to
the round, stone-built folds upon the hills.  Or in the macintosh
and shawl-enveloped women driving shaggy ponies in the farm-gigs;
or kilted and breeched, wearing the green armlet with the
red Crown and lettering,&mdash;carting mangolds or forking swedes,
herding rough-coated milch-cows back to the byres&mdash;or wheeling
red Post Office bicycles up steep brae-roads.
</p>

<p>
A fanged east wind spattering icy sleet, blew from the North
Sea across the Cheviots, and lights began to twinkle from
grey stone-built manses and slate-roofed farms.  Dark had
come down when the train stopped at Cauldstanes, the bleak
little granite station of the Border market-town.  The
dazzling blue-white headlights of a big Rolls-Royce car blazed in
the dark beyond the platform fence-rails.  A one-armed,
silver-badged male servant waited on the wet asphalte under
the jumping gas.  The Station Master, stout, white-bearded
and important, passed towards the rear of the train, demanding
a "ledda for Whingates."  Presently to return, loaded
with rugs, pillows and suit-cases, ushering the sought-for
lady,&mdash;who said in her characteristically staccato accents as
she bade her fellow-traveller adieu:
</p>

<p>
"Good-night and good-bye, if we never meet again!
Though this is a small world, isn't it?&mdash;and most roads seem
to cross at the Front.  No! you are Not to help with the
things! ... Mr. Smellie will be so obliging....  And here
is Padsworth.  Glad to see you so fit, Padsworth.  I've not
forgotten to bring the artificial arm!"
</p>

<p>
Thus Lady Wastwood, who vanished away into the conjectural
regions beyond the platform fence-rails, tall, thin,
triangular-faced, graciously smiling; attended by the laden
station-master and followed by the one-armed groom....
</p>

<p>
A red-cheeked girl in a macintosh and scarlet Tam O'
Shanter took the soldier's ticket at the gate in the
platform-railing, and cried in a strident key, intended for some
unseen ear:
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Govan, mem! ... Is Mrs. Govan no' ootside wi' the
doug-cairt frae the <i>Cross Keys</i>?"
</p>

<p>
A voice pleasanter, rounder and more womanly, came
back out of the blackness of the station entrance-yard,
crying:
</p>

<p>
"Ay, am I, Leezie!  Is Cornel Yaill there?"
</p>

<p>
Leezie shrieked back as the headlights of the Rolls-Royce
revolved, and the big car turning,&mdash;backed, snorted, forged
ahead and sped away on soundless tyres into the chilly
darkness:
</p>

<p>
"I kenna, but there's a sodger seekin' a nicht's lodgin'!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell him the <i>Cross Keys</i> wi' guid supper an' clean beddin'
is inside the meenute's walk frae here!" called back the
matronly voice.  "Losh me!  Whatna's that?"
</p>

<p>
As John Hazel stood outside the platform gate, in the
wind-blown flare of its solitary gas-lamp, another tall figure in
khaki had appeared from the velvety blur of blackness under
the eaves of the preposterous little booking-office; and
passing close to the head of the quiet beast between the shafts,
had halted by the off-wheel and spoken to the driver....
</p>

<p>
"Eh, Cornel!" the womanly voice went on, "Gude guide us,
but ye scairt me sair!  Risin' up oot o' the dairk richt under
auld Broonie's nose! ... But that the meir kens ye, the puir
beast micht have boltit.  An' wha' wad manage the <i>Cross
Keys</i> then, I wad weel like to know!"
</p>

<p>
The answer came in a man's deep voice, with an inflection
of melancholy underlying its pleasantness:
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry, Mrs. Govan.  But how is it I find you here,
on such a bitter night?"
</p>

<p>
"Huts!  The nicht's no' waur than ither for the time o'
year," Mrs. Govan retorted from her perch on the driver's
seat.  "An' the guidman being laid by wi' a sair hoast&mdash;forbye
a lad we canna' trust wi' a guid beast on a mirk night&mdash;there's
nane but mysel' to drive ye to Kerr's Arbour!"  The
speaker added, in the high keening tone which a Scotswoman
of her class invariably assumes in speaking of things having
reference to death and mourning; "An' haud ye back ae mair
half-hoor from ane that's thinkin' lang until ye come to
her&mdash;I wouldna'!  Not to win my ain lad Alec back frae the
Front the night!"  She went on as the person addressed
made a responsive sound of indeterminate meaning:
</p>

<p>
"But whatna's to hinder ye, Cornel Yaill, knowing the
road's weel as yer pocket, frae driving yersel&mdash;as ye've done to
my knowledge&mdash;mony an' mony a time before noo.  Up wi'
ye!"  She relinquished the reins and jumped down, nimbly
enough considering her years and matronly proportions, adding
as the man she addressed promptly assumed her vacated
seat....  "Bid them gie Broonie a het mesh, puir thing, she's
nane sae yoong as has been!&mdash;and mind ye send her back
wi' the cairt early in the morn's morn.  She'll be wantit to
bring Mr. Kellar, the lawyer, oot on business conneckit wi'
the Will!  Na, na!  I'll no' be needing a lift to the <i>Cross Keys</i>!
Here's a soger-man from Lunnon that's bound for the inn,
and needin' a wise body to guide him.  Gang yer ways wi'
guid luck!  Gie my love to Miss Forbis!"
</p>

<p>
The woman added as Yaill tightened the reins, and the
mare, answering a whip-touch with an indignant snort,
trotted away with the dog-cart into the sleety darkness:
</p>

<p>
"Your road's lang and ower rough.  But, O, Man! there's
a braw, braw leddy waiting to greet ye at the ither end!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0210"></a></p>

<h3>
X
</h3>

<p>
She was so braw a lady,&mdash;not only in the physical meaning
of splendid height and just bodily proportion; noble outlines
and sweet, healthful hues; hair as richly black-brown as
the bracken of her wintry braes, and eyes as tawny-golden as
the crystals of her Scottish mountains,&mdash;that the heart of the
man who loved and had lost her, seemed to shrivel and blister
in his bosom, as though some fierce corrosive acid had been
poured upon the throbbing flesh....
</p>

<p>
Again and again he said what he was coming to say, as
the willing mare, urged by no sparing hand, made good her
journey towards Kerr's Arbour.  Straining up steep bare
brae-roads; picking her way down slippery descents; plashing
through muddy bottoms walled with high cliff-banks clad with
funereal firs and shadowy larches, revealed by passing gleams
from the dog-cart's lamps.  As the high-road changed to a
hilly private road bordered by a plantation of conifers backed
by a wire park-fence, the beast, which had given signs of
distress unheeded by the man&mdash;checked at the steep with almost
a woman's sob....
</p>

<p>
Something in the sound wakened a dull pity in Edward
Yaill.  He got down, and walked beside Brownie, as she
slipped and stumbled on stones washed loose by the rain-scour;
and as a soldier will, he cursed the badness of the
road.  It was in a rotten state, compared to what it had been
before the War came to take its super-toll of human energy.
Sweeping into its huge and bloody maw gentle and simple,
noble and infamous, ignorant and learned, penniless and rich.
Nothing was the same.  Nothing would, could, ever be the
same again.  Life had been transmuted, not into gold&mdash;but
from honest silver into a strange, new ugly metal&mdash;in this vast,
comprehensive crucible of War....
</p>

<p>
Most hopelessly, irremediably changed of all human beings
was Edward Yaill.  Once a man meant by his Maker to inhabit
an earthly Paradise, by the warm, fragrant side of the
tenderest of mates.  To that sick-hearted wretch, dogged by a
pitiless Fate: outcast, or it seemed so to him&mdash;from decent
Society: traitor to the woman unswervingly worshipped
through the long years of a drawn-out engagement, it was
meagrest comfort to know himself blamelessly loyal.  Even
as a Saint who in the delirium of fever has heard his own
crazed voice blaspheming God....
</p>

<p>
In the horrible wreck and wastage of Yaill's plans, one
thought was clear.  He must get to Katharine first, and tell
her himself before others carried the tale.  He looked up at
the thin, pale face of the new moon coldly staring down at
him between overshadowing branches, and thought it judged
and condemned and repulsed him; like the face of the woman
in the train.  The woman knew Katharine Forbis&mdash;might even
have written to her.  He might find Kerr's Arbour mined,
when he got there.  A hundred things might have happened
to ruin his chances....  What chances he meant he did not
clearly know.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes his mood was cold as he tramped by Brownie,
and sometimes hot,&mdash;but always he tramped in Hell.  He was
going&mdash;going unless another had been before him, to break
the heart of the dearest of living women with five words of
his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!  I have married another!"  Afterwards adding:
"Even with my soul and body worshipping none but
you!"  Then&mdash;would she die with her great wide eyes reproaching
him?  Or would she drive him from her with words of scorn?
Scornful words would be unlike Katharine Forbis&mdash;Katharine
who rarely judged and seldom blamed.  But the silence
in which she would hear him out to an ending, would be
infinitely more tragic, unspeakably more terrible than wrath....
</p>

<p>
Insensibly beneath his feet the steepness levelled.  Another
mile and Kerr's Arbour would be in sight.  But Yaill walked
on, now obsessed and held by visions.  In mental flashes
Katharine came and went.
</p>

<p>
A hundred times they had climbed this hill together.  He
felt as though she moved beside him now.  He could see the
sleet-drops glistening on her smooth cheek, whipped to a sweet
carnation by the chilly wind.  The scent of camphor from her
furs came back to him, with the light pressure of her gloved
hand upon his arm.  In his ears were the tones of her nice
voice,&mdash;the frank glance of her fair eyes seemed to meet his,
for him were her gay words and her tender ones&mdash;like the
sweet smile upon her rather large mouth.  A smile that
expressed its owner's innate conviction&mdash;shared by the majority
of her acquaintances&mdash;that never under any imaginable
circumstances could Miss Forbis be unwelcome or undesirable
in the estimation of any being she chose to bless.  No wonder
her wretched Edward was wrung and tortured.  In vision
after vision she came and vanished, as he tramped beside the
now exhausted Brownie under the thin new February moon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The iron-hard ringing ground, slippery with cat-ice;
whitened with powdery hoar-frost; flowed on unheeded under
the footfalls of brute and human, who marched together to
a worsting Fate.  All Nature seemed to reproduce Yaill's
mood&mdash;the desolate, wintry hills, the eerie scream of the
whaups&mdash;frozen out of their feeding-grounds in marsh and
bogland,&mdash;the wailing cry of the hunting-owls, were in tune
with him.  The skirl of the north-east wind, honed to a razor-edge
on the Jutland coast&mdash;tanged with the freezing salt of the
wild North Sea; mined, patrolled, netted, guarded,&mdash;watched
from bleak shore to shore, and from the oozy depths, and from
the immeasurable heights of Air, by friends and foes, indomitable
in hatred,&mdash;echoed through the chambers of his desolate
heart....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the Spring of 1910 they had become engaged, and were
to have been married in the Winter of that year,&mdash;but her
mother had died&mdash;and Katharine had been unwilling to leave
her father, and there had been delays and delays....  And
then the wedding had been arranged to take place in the Autumn
of 1914, and the War had prevented it&mdash;the damnable War!
</p>

<p>
He ground his teeth, thinking of what the War had done
for him and for many another man as wretched&mdash;and the
distant hooting of the owls, freezing as they hunted freezing
rick-mice&mdash;and the shriek of the north-east wind&mdash;sounded like
Irish Banshees wailing the coming death of beautiful love....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For Katharine's love had always been perfectly beautiful.
She had been the ideal mate&mdash;the sweetheart who never palls.
She had fed her lover's heart with the wholesome bread of
tenderness, and never let his soul lack nourishment.  She had
met him full at every turn and exigency of Life&mdash;even as they
had moved to meet it side by side.  In the purest, most
spiritual sense these betrothed lovers were wedded&mdash;though
their ancient Church had not yet made them one.
</p>

<p>
And now he was hastening to meet her and pull down his
tower of love about his ears.  Why hurry? whooped the owls
and skirled the curlew.  If you are going to tell her as you
purpose, will you not reach Kerr's Arbour far too soon?  But
if you have the wisdom that men boast of&mdash;take what Life
yet may give ere you lose all....
</p>

<p>
He topped the crest of the final steep, and halted to let his
dumb companion breathe awhile....  Now the sharp tuff-tuff
of a motor-cycle came out of the distance behind him, and
he wondered who was having so cold a ride upon that road
to-night.  Even from this point he looked on his journey's
ending, with the sensation that a man may have in meeting
with a dying friend....
</p>

<p>
Nothing of beauty characterised Kerr's Arbour, an irregular
mass of masonry rising from a walled garden-courtyard shut
in by high yew-hedges: a stone wall and a <i>porte-cochère</i> of
ancient wrought-iron, beyond a bridged dry moat at the
bottom of the private road.  It showed as a rambling house of
Early Jacobean architecture tacked on to the peel-tower reared
by Sir Hew Forbis the Crusader, somewhere about 1147.  The
ancient battlemented tower was squat and clumsy, the rooms
with rare exceptions were low-pitched, the ancient casements
small, the stairways narrow, and the stone-flagged passages
anything but level to the tread.  But set in a fold of the
snow-tipped hills and shielded on North and East with plantations
of oak and evergreen, with the snow-veiled mirror of a little
lake, burn-fed, trouty, haunted with heron and other
waterfowl,&mdash;lying beyond the wintry gardens to the southward; with
chilly moonlight on its frosty battlements and lying in pools
upon its stone-flagged terrace; and smoke curling from its
clustered chimneys; with mingled firelight and lamplight
winking from well known windows&mdash;it caught at the wanderer's
heart as a vision of Home.
</p>

<p>
He looked up at the black-white sky, and it seemed to
his misery, that beyond that inky wrack and livid cumulus&mdash;hurrying
south like a curse rushing to fulfil itself&mdash;dwelt One
who in His high austere remoteness looked coldly on the pigmy
woes of men.  To Whom his pangs were the struggle of the
fly in the milk-jug,&mdash;the writhings of the worm severed by the
gardener's mattock,&mdash;the pain of the snail being beaten by the
thrush on the stone....
</p>

<p>
What, O what was it to Him that Katharine's love had
always been perfectly beautiful!  And that to live beggared
of all that wealth of sweetness&mdash;perhaps through all the years
of life to follow&mdash;would be sheer Hell to her lover, Edward
Yaill.
</p>

<p>
Yaill shrieked at the thought, as a man at the stab of the
bayonet&mdash;and the sweat broke out upon him, despite the cold.
His hand went out and gripped the shaft of the dog-cart, so
fiercely that the dogskin glove split....  Baulked passion,
thwarted desire rent and tore him.  Oh, what were Honour
and Truth but pithless meanings!  He would go down to
Kerr's Arbour where she waited, and love and be loved before
the ending came.  He would drink one draught of the wine
his soul and body craved for&mdash;before Fate dashed the cup out
of his hands.
</p>

<p>
So said, so it should be done.  He took the reins from the
hame-spike, and the flare of the wind-blown candle-lamp
showed his smile.  He sprang to his seat and snatched the
whip from the socket, and lashed the mare&mdash;who broke into
a furious gallop&mdash;the cart swinging and lurching perilously
behind her as she pounded madly down the steep descent.  At
the bottom lay the curve of the dry moat, crossed by what
had been a wooden drawbridge, converted in the reign of the
last Stuart monarch, into an arch of rough-cut granite blocks.
Beyond the bridge and a short avenue of beeches rose the
rust-red iron gates of Kerr's Arbour, with the arms of the
house wrought into their ancient tracery: a wolf's head crest
with the motto "FORBYS FOES FA" above a shield with the
plain device of three escallops <i>argent</i> on a <i>fesse</i> between two
chevrons <i>sable</i> and <i>gules</i>.
</p>

<p>
The gates stood open for the guest of honour.  On their
cracked stone pillars, topped with grotesque lead effigies of
wolves, each supporting the sword of a Crusader, oil lanterns
burned, dangling by chains from iron cressets (meant to hold
flares of greased or tarry tow).  A dog barked within, and the
cracked familiar voice of Whishaw, the butler, snapped out
angrily:
</p>

<p>
"Down, Dawtie!  Quiet, bitch!  Gin ye dinna ken the
Colonel, ye daumned eediot, canna ye haud yer tongue like
Laddie an' Bran?"
</p>

<p>
The dog-cart's worn tyres shirred on the gravel of the
courtyard.  Yaill leaped down.  The heavy nailed hall-door stood
wide open.  Warmth and light rushed together on the exile,
and the scent of flowers, the pretty smells of burning peat
and apple-wood, lavender, camphor and sandal from the great
Japan cabinets ranged in the hall, came to him in a satisfyingly,
fragrant whiff.  This was home....  Katharine's home....
And Katharine....  He trembled and a mist blurred his
vision&mdash;and then his sick heart leaped&mdash;because she came.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0211"></a></p>

<h3>
XI
</h3>

<p>
Came with a rush, and a whisper of silken draperies, straight
as an arrow to his starving heart.  The chastened passion of
her embrace of welcome&mdash;the guarded flame of ardour in her
kisses&mdash;the rapture in her pure eyes told her lover that he was
loved as dearly as of old.  Unchanged, O God!  She who
must learn to-morrow, perhaps to-night, to loathe the name of
Yaill....
</p>

<p>
She led him in, moving with the elastic step and upright
carriage that gave her, amongst other women, the air of an
uncrowned queen.  As they passed the chapel door he saw
through the stained glass that more lights burned there than
the ruby star of the Sanctuary Lamp.  She caught his puzzled
look, and whispered to him:
</p>

<p>
"Because my father lies there until his Funeral.  Presently
you shall see him, dearest Edward.  He always loved you like
another son."
</p>

<p>
Her father....  So he was dead, the fine old General.  It
was true that Yaill had been fond of the dear old fellow, in
some remote and shadowy long ago....  Now Katharine was
saying, in that blessed voice of hers:
</p>

<p>
"I was quite sure that when you got my cable, you would
come to me, if the surgeons said you were fit.  Not unless! ... I
made that clear!  You understood that, Edward?  You
would not have been so cruel as to come if it hurt you, dear?"
</p>

<p>
He moved his head after a non-committing fashion.  He
had to hide his ignorance of this cable, sent to the Convalescent
Camp at the B&mdash;&mdash; Base, announcing the death of which
he now first learned.  He realised that he brought with him
into this honourable dwelling, subterfuge, pretence,
concealment and evasion....  By use of these he must make his
way, warily, as over duckboards laid on quaking mud.  Presently
one would be lying....  Lying to Katharine, the crystal
soul of candour and honesty....
</p>

<p>
Now he was sitting upon her right at the dinner-table,
wondering at the keen appetite provoked in him by the savour
and sight of well-prepared, well-cooked food.  A pink-eyed,
silver-haired, Shetland-shawl-enveloped elderly lady, a
Mrs. Bell&mdash;once nursery governess to the Forbis children, and now
occupying an indefinable position in the household,&mdash;opposed
him upon Katharine's left hand; the carved oak arm-chair
usually occupied by the master of the house, remaining in its
place at the head of the table; a Persian cat, the dead man's
favourite, curled up asleep upon its faded seat....  Nor did
the dogs,&mdash;a collie, an old pointer-bitch, and a Scotch
deer-hound&mdash;desert their accustomed posts upon the threadbare
patches of the Turkey carpet; though uneasy whimpers testified
to their sense of strangeness, and their wistful eyes were
always on the door....  Once their tails drubbed and their
jaws slavered a welcome, when a thin elderly priest came in,
and bowing with the formal grace of the seminary&mdash;as Miss
Forbis introduced Colonel Yaill to Father Inghame&mdash;made a
remark about the bitter weather, and took the cover evidently
laid for him&mdash;upon the right of the master's empty chair.
</p>

<p>
He was fasting, for a dish of spinach with eggs was brought
to him, though Friday's dishes figured on the board.  He
looked fagged and ate with evident lack of appetite; admitting
in reply to Katharine's inquiries that the road to Peelston
Bridge was uncommonly trying&mdash;even for a cyclist inured to
conditions in France.  It transpired presently&mdash;for the priestly
reserve yielded to the charm of Yaill's voice, his courtesy and
soldierly frankness&mdash;that Father Inghame was not a Secular
priest but a Religious of the Order of St. Gerard; who had
served as chaplain attached to a Division of the First British
Expeditionary Force; received a shrapnel-wound in the First
Battle of the Aisne, and had come home in charge of a Hospital
convoy.  Further, that he was discharging the easy duties
incumbent on the resident chaplain at Kerr's Arbour, until his
health should be sufficiently re-established, in the opinion of
his Superior&mdash;to warrant his return to the Front.
</p>

<p>
"Which I hope may be soon, very soon!" he ended.  "For
I think that Miss Forbis will not misunderstand me, when I
say that I want to get back to real work.  To eat the bread
of idleness in comfort and safety while brave men are dying
hourly in muddy trenches, is not&mdash;for a priest who is
able-bodied and hardy enough&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To subsist upon the rocky biscuit, and munch the iron
ration of War!" said Yaill's deep, soft voice with the
under-note of melancholy; "Men who have done far less than
yourself, Father," he went on, "are content with ordinary
War-conditions at home.  Would not the charge of a crowded
Mission in the East or West End of London&mdash;or possibly in a
Hertfordshire village, with the certainty of&mdash;say two
bomb-raids per week, be sufficient to satisfy your thirst for risks?"
</p>

<p>
Father Inghame returned with a queer hot light burning
in each of his hollow eyes, and a flush rising under his sallow
skin:
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Colonel, you overrate the small part that I have
been permitted to play in the opening acts of this unfinished
drama of Armageddon."  He went on, prompted to pay a
genuine tribute of admiration to the distinguished soldier
whose heroism was as proverbial in the mouths of men as the
record of his misfortunes: "Compared with the experiences
that you have passed through, such as have fallen to my lot
are, to say the least of them, trivial.  Except with regard to
the conduct of those Catholic soldiers whom it has been my
privilege to confess and communicate.  How often when I
have passed through the trenches under heavy shell-fire,
carrying the Blessed Sacrament,&mdash;I have seen them take off
their shrapnel-helmets&mdash;though shell-splinters were flying
about, and machine-gun bullets whistling overhead.  And with
what childlike simplicity and faith they would kneel in the
stinking mud to receive their Saviour!  And with what
sublime endurance and resignation they have rendered up their
souls to God....  All my life long, I shall be rich in such
memories: bequeathed to me, not only by Catholics, but by
Protestants, Presbyterians, Dissenters, and members of the
Church of England,&mdash;whom I have seen die with the light of
Faith upon their blackened faces&mdash;whispering the prayer that
was made by God for men!"
</p>

<p>
"The splendid men!" said Katharine's full warm voice.
"Oh! how can we ever be proud enough of these men of
ours!  Haven't I <i>hugged</i> myself whenever I remembered&mdash;'I
am your countrywoman, you great dears!'"
</p>

<p>
Yaill's eyes met hers, and an exquisite thrill was
interchanged between them.  When they were once more conscious
of the outer world, the Father was saying&mdash;with some lack of
tactful prevision:
</p>

<p>
"It is said there were a good many Catholics in the rank
and file of your regiment.  In the First and Second Battalions
of 'The Tweedburghs,' in 1914&mdash;as in those battalions
reconstituted," he hesitated, "after the disasters of Le
Cateau-Cambrésis and Loos&mdash;I have heard the percentage estimated at
twenty-five."
</p>

<p>
"The estimate is correct," Yaill answered, speaking with
admirable composure, though a tell-tale muscle fluttered in his
lean brown cheek, and Katharine drew a quick breath of
painful sympathy.  He added, with a curious intonation: "Yet,
despite scapulars, medals, rosaries, badges and other practical
life-assurances&mdash;the Catholic men you speak of lie under
stinking mud with other fellows now.  Ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
And he laughed with such unnaturally loud and mirthless
violence, that Whishaw at the sideboard jumped and dropped
a dish-cover, and Katharine's sweet eyes went to him in grave
surprise.
</p>

<p>
Those eyes of Katharine's, "of gold and bramble-dew," never
strayed long from the face of her dear one.  She was nurse
as well as lover, and that strange laughter had filled her with
dismay.  She wished that the Father had been wise enough
to shun the agonising subject.  Why had it not occurred to
her to warn him not to refer to Edward's terrible experiences,
she asked herself, aching in sympathy with Edward's pain.
But thin ice is a lure to some skaters,&mdash;these not the most
brilliant performers.  Father Inghame pursued, in a tone that
was not untinged with rebuke:
</p>

<p>
"You would not suggest, I feel sure, Colonel, that the
Catholic men of your own or any other regiment regarded
rosaries, scapulars and medals as charms and mascots&mdash;and
not as legitimate aids to faith?"
</p>

<p>
Yaill's face hardened to a mask of pale brown granite.  His
fine dark brows drew sternly into line.  His grey eyes
gleamed, and below the clipped moustache a faint smile
hovered.  He played with the stem of an antique wine-glass of
cut green crystal; twirling it in the long sensitive fingers of
a hand as beautifully shaped as strong.  And he returned,
while feigning to admire the delicate workmanship of the
long-dead engraver:
</p>

<p>
"You are right.  I intended to convey no such suggestion."  He
changed the trend of the conversation by asking the little
pink-eyed Mrs. Bell when she had last heard from her son in
India.  And his agreeable, well-bred tones gave no hint of
the frenzy of impotent resentment raging within him against
the Supreme Power Who set the pellet Earth with her sister
planets, to follow their orbits round the white-hot Sun&mdash;and
modelled the lord of the world&mdash;Man, in the form of the
Creator; and set in his breast a spark of Divine Intelligence;
and bade him live, and love, and be loved again&mdash;O anguish!&mdash;a
finite being with immortal yearnings&mdash;condemned to dwell
in the upas-shadow of Death.
</p>

<p>
To house an immortal Soul in the breast of a pigmy, in
the blood of whose veins armies of microbes make War.
Whose tiny gullet can be blocked by a swallowed fish-bone;
whose seeing eye, that miracle of miracles, by a thorn-prick
or a blow can be rendered blind!  Whose brain, that has
solved the secrets of Creation; reduced the Universe to its
chemical constituents; made an ally of the once tameless
lightning; abolished Time, and annihilated Distance; set bounds
which Plague and Pestilence may not overpass; made ships to
fly in Air and sail below water&mdash;may by a blow be mashed in
its eggshell skull.  Or by the detonation of a shell packed with
High Explosive, be churned to merest pap of grey matter,
dead to sensation, incapable of Thought.  Or be so thrown
out of gear as to order the body to speech, impulses, acts, in
opposition to the Will.  Seemingly sane, O horrible, horrible
mockery! until the awakening from trance or stupor, or
whatever the vile bedevilment may be.  From the condition of
No. 40, Shell Shock Ward 8, General Casualty Hospital 70&mdash;and
the state of No. 80, Convalescent British Officers Camp,
B&mdash;&mdash; Base&mdash;to the present plight of the complainant; captive
within the enclosure of a sacramental vow!
</p>

<p>
This was the rankling grievance nursed by Edward Yaill
against his Maker.  The son of a Catholic house, reared in
the Faith, loyal to the Church, scrupulous in the discharge
of religious duties, he had never for one instant imagined
himself at variance with his God.  That he could quit the fold
of Catholic Christianity on the grounds of intellectual doubt,
he knew to be impossible.  Like the devils, he believed&mdash;even
while he revolted.  His was the pain of the child who, loving
the father, has discovered him to be unjust.  The muscle
twitched in his lean cheek, and a quiver passed over his stern
features as a ripple will traverse the surface of still water.
And to Katharine's tender, watching eyes, it seemed that all
was not well with Edward.  She breathed a little silent prayer
to Our Lady for him, and unconsciously her large white
hands folded together on the tablecloth.  They were
beautifully-modelled hands, with tapering fingers, and nails that had
been exquisite in pre-War days.  The damaged nails that gallant
British women were not at all ashamed to show.
</p>

<p>
Yaill knew that those fair hands had done distasteful,
rough, laborious tasks with glorious goodwill and cheerfulness.
He loved them and admired them all the more.  He
could picture them holding up the drooping head of a wounded
man&mdash;or offering cool drink to the parching lips of the dying.
He had sipped sparkling burn-water from their cupped palms
many a time on a hot day up yonder on the moors.  He had
seen them folded in prayer, he had covered them with kisses
by her sweet permission.  When he had bidden her good-bye
upon leaving for the Front&mdash;she had taken his head between
those hands, and kissed him solemnly upon the forehead&mdash;and
traced the sign of the Cross there&mdash;as his mother might have
done, had she been alive.  And God, Whom he had served
and trusted&mdash;had for no fault of his, taken from Yaill who
worshipped her&mdash;this pearl and paragon among women.  And
upon this count he held himself betrayed.
</p>

<p>
There would never be "<i>Nil</i>" upon Yaill's disc, but he had
finished with prayer, and the Sacraments, and Mass-going for
ever....  Unless&mdash;by some marvellous&mdash;miraculous happening,
the Great Wrong should be set right.

</h3>

<p>
Dinner ended.  Little, pink-eyed Mrs. Bell enveloped herself
in her Shetland shawls and discreetly vanished, with a plaintive
murmur of good-night.  Yaill, with set, formal courtesy,
giving precedence to the Church&mdash;followed Father Inghame
and Katharine through a curtained archway communicating
with the adjoining drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Miss Forbis, but I will not stay for coffee.  I
have to make a visit to the chapel&mdash;and write some letters, and
after night-prayers I shall go to bed, for I am beat out.  I
only wanted to say that Father Haildon, the priest in charge
of your Parish Church at Birkleas, will celebrate the Requiem
Mass on Monday; and that the Father Superior of the Monastery
at Scraeside," he named a place some miles distant from
Birkleas,&mdash;"will esteem it an honour to be permitted to assist.
He will bring a Jesuit priest from London who is staying at
the Monastery (Father Bevan, of Farm Place, Grosvenor
Crescent)&mdash;and all are agreed that ten o'clock will be the most
suitable hour.  The boys of the Birkleas choir will drive over
in the break with Father Haildon; and the lady who acts as
organist will take the place of Mrs. Bell.  That is all, except
to wish you a very good night!"  He shook hands with Miss
Forbis and moved in the direction of the door opening on the
hall, adding: "Mass will be at half-past seven as usual
to-morrow.  Perhaps&mdash;" his eyes went doubtfully to the tall khaki
figure and downward-bent, thoughtful face of Yaill, who stood
upon the worn tiger-skin hearthrug with a hand gripping
the ledge of the mantelshelf: "perhaps as Whishaw's grandson
has influenza, Colonel Yaill would like to serve Mass?"
</p>

<p>
There was an instant's pause before Yaill answered.  He
stared into the wood and peat fire blazing in the antique
bowed steel grate, and seemed as though he had not heard.  A
log hissed; spurted brilliant flame; broke and fell&mdash;scattering
sparks upon the old Dutch hearth-tiles.  Two or three lodged
upon the tiger-skin, mingling the fragrance of the charring
apple-wood with the ugly acrid tang of frizzling hair.  Then
Yaill said, punctuating the sentence with stamps of his boot-heel:
</p>

<p>
"I fear I must&mdash;ask&mdash;to be excused, sir."
</p>

<p>
The priest's response was the gentle opening and closing of
the door.  Then with her long light step and a whisper of
silken draperies, Katharine crossed over and stood on the
hearth at her lover's side.  He did not move or lift his head,
but his starved heart answered the call of her nearness with a
leap of fierce delight.  His arm went out and round her, and
she leaned lightly against him, and whispered against his cheek,
close to his ear:
</p>

<p>
"If you knew what joy it is to me, to have you! ... Dear
Edward!  I am not much good at words&mdash;but you understand?"
</p>

<p>
He said, stiffening his lips against his teeth to check their
trembling:
</p>

<p>
"No words have yet been made to express what you are
to me&mdash;Dearest of all women!&mdash;and have been always, since
the blessed hour when I saw you first!"
</p>

<p>
She was not a woman from whom to exact caresses.  You
waited the moment when she was pleased to give.  Now she
swayed nearer and her bosom brushed his&mdash;and the world
went dim as they exchanged a kiss....
</p>

<p>
Last time they had met she had worn a Regulation tunic and
short uniform skirt of blue serge, thick high Service boots
and a plain blue felt hat with an enamelled Red Cross badge,
and had been no less beautiful in his eyes.  Now her tall lithe
shapeliness was in silken raiment, like the beautiful arched
feet in their buckled shoes.  The rigorous plainness of her
mourning dress added to her beauty, with its pure strong
outlines and rich creamy skin.  Her high-bred simplicity was
the dominant note of her&mdash;or was it her generosity, her
sympathy, or her piety? ...
</p>

<p>
A man had once said to Yaill in the early stages of the
friendship that had changed so quickly into passionate
love:
</p>

<p>
"She would be enchanting if she were not so holy!"
</p>

<p>
And Yaill had answered, with his grave eyes following her:
</p>

<p>
"Holiness is the bloom upon the nectarine."
</p>

<p>
Well, it was true.  She was all the more attractive for
the piety that graced her beauty, the devotion that exhaled
from her, unconsciously as the fragrance from the rose....
Like Yaill's dead mother, she had no use for a man who was
not religious.  She had a standard and expected her beloveds
to live up to it.  And Yaill had done so, according to his
lights.
</p>

<p>
She leaned closer, and her long, beautiful arm curved across
his tunic, and her fond hand stroked the ribbons on his breast.
Lingering over them, enumerating with silently moving lips
the list of her man's distinctions, from the orange-centred
blue and red of the Queen's medal of the South African War
of 1899-1901, to the red ribbon of the Victoria Cross; the
rainbow of the Star of Mons: the blue-edged red of the
D.S.O. the white-mauve-white of the Military Cross; and the green,
red-lined ribbon of Belgium's Croix de Guerre&mdash;with the sweet
colour coming and going in her cheeks, and her dark lashes
lowered over the shining cairngorm eyes.  His sick heart ached
anew, she was so wifely; and so womanly in her insistence on
her point.  For she went on urging:
</p>

<p>
"Then, I may tell Father Inghame that you will serve Mass
on my father's last day in the old home, and in his place? ... He
would yield the privilege to no one&mdash;unless it were my
brother Julian&mdash;so gladly as to you.  Say that I may say
'Yes!'"
</p>

<p>
Yaill's deep voice answered, slowly and heavily:
</p>

<p>
"He was a good man.  No better ever lived, I am quite
certain.  And under most conceivable circumstances&mdash;to me his
wish would be law.  But I cannot take his place beside the
altar or even attend at Mass."
</p>

<p>
He felt her start.  She asked him quickly:
</p>

<p>
"There is some reason&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There is of course a reason!"  He stirred a smouldering
log with the toe of his high boot.
</p>

<p>
"Your health?"  Her voice had the sharpened edge of
anxiety, and her bosom rose and fell with her quickened breath.
His starved eyes dwelt on the modelling of her wide brows,
the black lashes of the sweet eyelids that dropped under his
scrutiny, the setting of her head on the throat's white column,
the superb width of her shoulders, the arch of her deep
chest....
</p>

<p>
"Your health....  There is more to hear than I have been
told&mdash;is there not?  Don't keep&mdash;anything back from me,
Edward.  Nothing is so terrible to bear as suspense."
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing....  Have you ever known me keep
anything back from you, my dearest?" he asked, in wonder
at his own hypocrisy.  For he knew that to have answered, "I
have lost the Faith" would be to her an overwhelming blow.
"Now tell me of Julian.  You wrote to me that"&mdash;the speaker
hesitated, mentally groping, "that he had applied to his
Superior General and got leave to volunteer for service as a
Chaplain with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force."
</p>

<p>
"That was in last December.  But the permission was
delayed, as I wrote you later, and he sailed for Lemnos with
the 29th Division a year ago this February.  We heard from
him next from Gallipoli,&mdash;such brave, cheerful letters.  But
since August 21st....  Oh, Edward!"  She caught her breath
sharply and paled and reddened.  "Since the 21st not a
line&mdash;not a single line!"
</p>

<p>
Yaill's forehead knitted in the effort to remember.  Thin,
thin ice here.  He must go warily....
</p>

<p>
She went on:
</p>

<p>
"We know from the despatches published in the newspapers
and from letters written to us by friends of Julian's, that he
went forward with his brigade when the 29th Division fought
through the scrub-fire to the top of Scimitar Hill....  When
the terrible Turkish shrapnel swept them back down the
hillside Julian stayed with the wounded&mdash;giving First Aid and
comforting the dying.  A brother Religious of St. Gerard who
was with the Eleventh Division, visited us here afterwards and
told us; 'Father Forbis was splendid!' ... 'One of the
Church's many heroes!' he called him.  But he could enlighten
us no more than the people at the War Office....  And it
broke my heart to look at Father&mdash;as the weeks went by and
by without bringing any news....  He bore it in silence, but
he has suffered dreadfully.  I have heard him over and over,
walking up and down at night in his bedroom.  And by day
one could see him hanging on the hope of a wire from
Whitehall.  Oh, Edward!&mdash;the wire that never will come, perhaps!
That last day I saw Father alive, when he rode out with his
Adjutant to put the last polish on the Fourth and Fifth
Squadron of his Yeomanry at Cauldstanes Muirlees
Racecourse&mdash;he looked so beautiful that my heart swelled big for
pride in him,&mdash;and so sorrowful that I had to run away to
cry.  And he waved to me and rode up the brae without
looking back to wave again, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here Katharine broke down and sobbed, and Yaill caressed
his love and soothed her, setting fresh tears running in the
channels that had long been dry.  She had wept bitterly when
Mark had been killed at Mons, though when the Tweedburgh
Regiment had been wiped out near Loos, and Yaill had suffered
in the blowing-in of the advanced telephone-communication
dug-out, the news had reached her on the morning of an
attack by German aircraft on the Clearing Hospital, and there
had been not a single moment to spend in selfish grief.  This
last blow, coming as it had, had left her numbed to the
centre of her being.  Until this moment she had not cried at
all ...
</p>

<p>
Yaill said, when she grew calm at last, lifting his strong
brown hand to his lips, and drying with a kiss a shining drop
that had fallen on it:
</p>

<p>
"We must hope for the best for Julian.  He may be a
prisoner with the Turks, or wounded,"&mdash;he spoke hoarsely&mdash;"or
suffering after some such fashion as&mdash;makes it impossible
to communicate with&mdash;those whom he loves."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," she said, knowing that his own case rose in
mind, "my poor, poor dear!"  And the wretched man grew
sick at heart and shuddered.  The mothering note in her voice
called to him across the years of an engagement senselessly
prolonged, that he might have heard it cooing to their children,
or whispering love-words through many, many wasted nights.
And the more hopelessly he yearned to her, the more he
shrank from the solicitude in her sweet eyes.  He had seen
those eyes flame with generous anger, and sparkling with mirth,
and dewy with tenderness.  Now they were full of sorrow
mingled with love for him.  He tried to imagine how they
would look her scorn....
</p>

<p>
For when she knew all the truth, she must despise him.
That was the thing that made his heart a hell.  The knowledge
that no one could possibly believe in the innocence of the fellow
who had done this hideous, brutal, beastly thing.
</p>

<p>
"Shell-shock, no doubt!"  He heard the voices saying it,
and saw the shake of sympathetic heads.  "Shell-shock! ... How
quite frightfully sad!"  And through the eyeholes of the
masks of sympathy, pity, commiseration&mdash;he saw the wriggle
of the little snake of Doubt.
</p>

<p>
Were the truth known to the world, no one could ever
believe it.  He would lie, therefore, until it came to light.
He would have the joy of these last hours spent beside
Katharine, to remember when she banished him for ever from her
side.
</p>

<p>
To Katharine, whose sore heart was eased by that burst of
weeping, the joy of Edward restored shone through her sorrow
as the sun through a snow-fog or a mountain mist.  By and
by, when Yaill settled into a well-known arm-chair, she hesitated
but another instant before sinking with one swift, supple
movement, down upon the hearthrug at her lover's side.  He
refused to smoke; she knew out of respect for the presence
of Death in that bereaved, masterless house.  She whispered,
leaning her forehead against his shoulder, surrendering her
hand to the warm, strong, masculine clasp:
</p>

<p>
"By and by we will go in together and see him.  Shall we
not, dearest?  He would wish it!"
</p>

<p>
Yaill muttered, looking at the engagement-ring of Indian
turquoises that he had placed years back on the fair womanly
hand within his own:
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  If it will not be&mdash;too hard for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Too hard!  O no, dear Edward!"  The hearth-blaze lightened
on her broad forehead as she raised it.  "The hardness
will be when he is there no longer, to talk to and to look at
and to pray for....  To pray to, as well, being with the Holy
Souls.  It is wonderful to think now; '<i>He is with my mother!</i>'"
</p>

<p>
"And Mark, and your little sister Rosamond."
</p>

<p>
"And Julian, perhaps.  He knows now, whether Julian was
killed or taken prisoner....  Turks are cruel to their captives,
are they not?"
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes...."
</p>

<p>
The muscle in Yaill's thin cheek twitched.  He moved restlessly:
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes....  But do not dwell on these possibilities,
or torture yourself with useless conjectures.  Even in the
shadow of the bereavement that has fallen upon this dear home,
we are together....  Together, Katharine!"
</p>

<p>
She turned and kissed the fine dark khaki cloth of his sleeve,
lingeringly echoing:
</p>

<p>
"'Together.'  Doesn't it seem&mdash;rather too good to be real?
After all that has been&mdash;the cruel years of parting, the shock
of calamity; the rush and roar of events, the ugly things of
War, the horror of dreadful news&mdash;the suspense of waiting&mdash;for
letters from you&mdash;letters that never came&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I could not&mdash;did not&mdash;" he stammered miserably and broke
off.
</p>

<p>
Her strong, fine hand closed upon his reassuringly.
</p>

<p>
"My own love, did I ever for a moment, lose faith in you?
Did I ever cease to write, though I never heard? ..."
</p>

<p>
He groaned in spirit, remembering his discovery of those
letters....  Square envelopes containing two or three sheets
of ribbed linen note-paper, covered with Katharine's clear free
script....  The pocket of an old writing-case of his was
stuffed with them&mdash;they had crammed that damned Japanese
workbox to the lid!
</p>

<p>
Again she breathed:
</p>

<p>
"Though I never heard from you I kept on writing.  Each
letter like a cry from my heart to yours."
</p>

<p>
Words burst from him:
</p>

<p>
"As God hears me, I never got one of those letters!"
</p>

<p>
She drew a troubled breath and said wonderingly, with
sweet, perplexed eyes seeking light from his:
</p>

<p>
"Not at the time they were written, dear, possibly.  But
your nurse did read them to you, Edward?&mdash;as soon as you
could bear it, that is."
</p>

<p>
"Did she?"
</p>

<p>
"She was very kind.  I was very grateful to her."
</p>

<p>
"Was she? ... Were you? ..."
</p>

<p>
The sweat stood in beads upon his brow and temples, and
his strained knuckles showed white through the sunburnt
skin.
</p>

<p>
"Kind, I mean, in writing to break the cruel truth to me,
that you&mdash;Edward!&mdash;let us forget about this!"
</p>

<p>
"It will be best," he said in a low constrained tone, not
looking at her.  "But tell me first what truth she broke to
you?"
</p>

<p>
"The truth&mdash;"  He felt her warm mouth upon his hand,
"that your mind was quite a blank with regard to me.  That
was the news that came in her first letter from the
Convalescent Camp at B&mdash;&mdash; Base.  I have not kept the
letter&mdash;I could not!&mdash;but the date I shall remember always.  October
28th, 1915."
</p>

<p>
It had been true then.  The effort to remember; to conjure
up figures, faces, associations, places, out of the Great
Blank that had followed the shell-burst&mdash;had been attended by
blinding headache, spasms of sickness and nights of insomnia.
Katharine went on:
</p>

<p>
"I wrote to her&mdash;Nurse Burtonshaw&mdash;at the Camp,&mdash;and
thanked her, and said that I would go on writing to you
exactly the same.  My work involved some risk.  If I had been
killed, you would have learned from those letters that I never
once forgot you, Edward, dear!  So I asked your nurse to put
them by in some safe keeping-place, and when God in His
Mercy should restore my darling's memory, to give them
to him, with his Katharine's love.  For I never doubted that
you would recover, Edward.  If I had, for one moment&mdash;how
could I have gone on working?  I must have given up hope!
I must&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The break in her dear voice supplied the missing end to
the sentence:
</p>

<p>
"I must have broken down and died!"
</p>

<h3>
XIII
</h3>

<p>
When a man's own organs, senses, wits conspire against
him, in league with an enamoured woman who plays traitress,
what earthly chance has the man?
</p>

<p>
Yaill stared into the glowing rose-red heart of the fire,
conjuring up for the thousandth time that part played
by one brown puppet of a myriad of puppets similarly attired,
in War's dread drama; cheek by jowl, night in and day out&mdash;with
the grim tragi-comedian Death; whose paces, poses and
antics, grown commonplace by dint of familiarity&mdash;at length
ceased to cause a shudder, or provoke a passing jest....
</p>

<p>
The War....  A waking nightmare of cold, heat, thirst and
hunger; exertion, anxiety, responsibility, fatigue; sleeplessness
and NOISE, NOISE, in a ceaseless, maddening crescendo, until
that flaming white-hot moment when the German 5.9 H.E. shell
blew in the Advanced Telephone Communication dug-out.
When consciousness of these things abruptly ceased for Yaill.
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass that stark-naked as when he was born
into this world, save for a platinum disc-chain on his wrist,
bearing his name, religion, rank and regiment, and a small
gold Crucifix slung by a blackened cord about his neck, Number
40, Shell Shock Ward 8, General Casualty Hospital 70,
on the Lines of Communication, came into being.  Later on,
when the Great Blank had given place to a drab-hued mental
twilight, wherein men, women and children; animals, trees
and houses could dimly be conjectured or unemotionally
discerned; and a little later yet, when one began again to realise
oneself a living puppet, playing a dull, dull part in a dreary
production called Life,&mdash;with some character dimly sensed as
missing from the cast, whose presence would have made a
world of difference!&mdash;Number 80, Convalescent Officers'
Camp, B&mdash;&mdash; Base, began to take what other nurses called
a "good deal of notice" of Nurse Lucy Burtonshaw.
</p>

<p>
You are to conceive of Nurse Burtonshaw as anything but
a purposeful Delilah.  The piously-reared daughter of one
Burton, a respectable West of England dairy-farmer,&mdash;calling
herself "Burtonshaw" for reasons of her own, while serving
in concert with thousands of other admirable young British
women, enrolled for Service at Home and Overseas under the
auspices of the Red Cross,&mdash;how shall she be held blameworthy
because there beat under her Navy blue lustre overall, and
white bibbed apron with its badge of red twill Turkey, a
woman's heart, susceptible to Love....
</p>

<p>
Does any woman wonder?  Does any man ask Why?  Nurse
Lucy Burtonshaw had washed Number 80; combed him, fed
him, dressed him,&mdash;and put him to bed again.  Administered
general massage and tonics, and superintended the ministrations
of the orderly-barber, unwearying, for months on end.
She had soothed him,&mdash;waking from brief daylight sleeps in
panics bred of hideous, nerve-shattering visions,&mdash;reproductions
of such sights,&mdash;burned in upon the brain and reproduced
by the subconscious memory, as made the nights grim ordeals
of dread.  She had alternately scolded and encouraged her
patient, gaining strength mentally and physically under her
unselfish, able care, until she had established herself as the hub
of his universe.  The sky and sea, the flowers and trees, and
that fresh West Country face with its blunt features and
well-opened grey-blue eyes, were the only books the patient ever
cared to read in.  The printed lines, the written sheets, were
torture to Yaill's dazed brain and astigmatic vision.  So the
Commandant's private secretary attended to his business letters,
and the correspondence of his friends was dealt with by
Nurse....
</p>

<p>
Upon her arm at first, by her side later, he took his first
walks in the Convalescent Camp grounds.  When later still,
he was taken for drives in the company of other shell-shocked
officers, it was Nurse Burtonshaw who persuaded him not to
rebel against this order of the C.M.O....  Nurse, who waited
for the return of the big, crowded car and unpacked him,
smiling, at the gates of Canvas Park Row, the double avenue
of roomy tents pitched on the green, tree-clumped slopes rising
North of the Base Port, behind the big square stone house
where the Staff officers and quarters were,&mdash;and the huge,
shapeless, plank-built zinc-roofed bulk of the Hospital.
</p>

<p>
"There now, you're back again and no bones broken.  And
whether you liked it or not, the air has done you good,"
she would say cheerfully, unwinding his muffler, knitted by
herself in her scant spare time.  For all Yaill's personal,
immediate baggage had been destroyed by a Boche bomb-raid upon
Battalion Staff Headquarters, and as Number 80 never wrote
letters, such lacking necessaries had been replaced by Red
Cross gifts.
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, when some battered portmanteaux were received
from Regimental H.Q. in France,&mdash;but of that later in
the chapter....  You are to see Nurse taking off the muffler,
over which her patient stared down at her with grey, brooding,
mournful eyes.  Those eyes followed her about, burning holes
in her grey print.  If she had established herself as the hub
of Number 80's universe, she was none the less the adoring
slave of him whom&mdash;in private and at his entreaty she called
"Teddy."
</p>

<p>
For Lord help this bedevilled man! he who in all his
thirty-five years of life had been "Edward" to all who loved him,
holding pet names in abhorrence,&mdash;had invited Nurse
Burtonshaw to address him by this fond diminutive.  "My mother
used to call me 'Teddy,'" he would say, with his sad eyes
brimming: "and though she has married again&mdash;" the poor
widowed lady being dead and buried years previously&mdash;"and I
am nothing to her now, I somehow like to hear it."
</p>

<p>
So Nurse called him "Teddy," scrupulously selecting
moments when they were quite alone and out of earshot.  Then
Teddy, who was a Border laird of ancient lineage, as well as
a Squire in Cumberland, with a solid rent-roll of four thousand
a year, some thriving home-farms and a park of many acres,
confided to Nurse that he was a poor man&mdash;without a rap
beyond his pay.  But if Lucy had no fear of poverty, shared
with a poor broken wretch who loved her&mdash;one to whom the
love of woman had been a sealed book until he saw her
face....
</p>

<p>
"You're getting too stuck on that Colonel man of yours,
Burtonshaw!" expostulated a friend some hours later on, when
the day-nurses went off duty.  "Because when it comes to
kissing Good-night&mdash;and I couldn't help but hear!&mdash;the
partition between the O.C. wards being merely canvas!  Of course
you can trust me not to talk, though I hope you won't again!&mdash;a
warm handshake as between friends being properer, and
not against the Regulations&mdash;which I will say I never knew
you go against before.  Now own up.  Am I right, or wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, I'll own it....  I do truly feel for Number 80,"
admitted Nurse Burtonshaw.  "He's alone in the world and
quite poor, though three hundred and seventy pounds a year,
which is his pay&mdash;not counting War allowances,&mdash;seems like
riches to little me."
</p>

<p>
"Bless me!" cried the friend, "then you've actually
clicked! ... He's asked you to marry him? ..."
</p>

<p>
Nurse Burtonshaw demanded, with rather a defiant flare
lighting up her well-opened grey-blue eyes, and with a decided
deepening of the steady bloom on her broad, blunt-featured
West of England face, nunlike in the setting of flowing white
linen hiding the rich red-gold hair that was her one
undeniable beauty:
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I'd let him kiss me&mdash;a girl brought up like
I've been&mdash;unless he'd behaved himself honourable?  Not one
of my friends can say a word&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what will <i>his</i> friends say about you?" asked the other
nurse acutely, "when they hear how you've fixed things?  To
marry a Regular Army toff, who not so long ago was queer in
his head, and had to be mothered and seen to and fed as if
he'd been a blinking baby&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Nurse Burtonshaw asserted:
</p>

<p>
"He's well, and going to get his discharge next week.
They say his cure's my doing.  And he's got no friends.  He's
told me so, over and over again!"
</p>

<p>
"That makes it better for you.  And I'm not saying that
you won't turn out a happy pair, not for a minute!  Don't
lots of patients marry their nurses and live happy ever after?
And, whenever I've read your teacup, Fate has seemed to point
that way.  But as to his having no friends&mdash;that won't half
wash!"
</p>

<p>
"And why won't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Just because your Teddy's a Society Toff, poor or not poor!
Belongs to a crack Scotch regiment....  Gets lots of letters
in lovely envelopes with the names of topping County places
on some of 'em&mdash;and coronetted crests and monograms...."
</p>

<p>
"The smart folks who wrote those letters don't count.  Hasn't
he told me?  'Not one of them,' he says,&mdash;'matters to me a
straw.'"
</p>

<p>
"He may have said so, but are you <i>sure</i>?  I'm asking out of
friendship.  Wasn't there a woman&mdash;isn't there a woman who
writes as if he mattered to her more than several stacks of
straw?  Oh, Luce! ..."
</p>

<p>
Nurse Burtonshaw stood her ground obstinately:
</p>

<p>
"I've questioned him over and over....  'I may have liked
her, since she says I did,' he says....  'But all the same, she's
less than nought to me....  What did you say her name
was?' he asks in that simple way of his." ...
</p>

<p>
"And did you tell him?"
</p>

<p>
"What does that matter to you?"
</p>

<p>
"It'll matter to you one of these days, as sure as I'm
certificated!  And you told me she'd begged you to keep the
letters until he was able to read them without hurting his head.
You haven't given them to him! ... Straight&mdash;are you going
to?  Infirmary-trained we both may be, and not Hospital&mdash;but
I hope we know what's due to the professions to say
nothing of the Red Cross!  When will you give him those
letters?"
</p>

<p>
Behind Nurse Burtonshaw's blue-grey eyes a red flame
kindled.  She retorted, confronting her interlocutor:
</p>

<p>
"When he asks me to!  Haven't I told you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much, you haven't.  And about your first venture&mdash;with
the Didlick boy&mdash;poor thing!  Killed at Mons and buried
no one knows where&mdash;are you going to tell him about that?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;am&mdash;NOT! ... Is that plain enough? ... Now let me
get to bed!"
</p>

<p>
When Katharine should learn that those letters, written
from her post of service at the Receiving Hospital in France,
and later from a London Nursing Home,&mdash;and later still from
Kerr's Arbour,&mdash;had never been delivered to Nurse Burtonshaw's
patient, would she believe&mdash;Yaill wondered dismally,
or doubt like all the rest of the world, the man who had
married the nurse?

<p>
He had told the girl, according to her, that though the letters
on his disc proclaimed him Catholic, he was just as much
a Protestant as anything....  And a Church of England
clergyman&mdash;not the Chaplain attached to the Convalescent
Camp&mdash;but the pastor of a Protestant church in the town had
been consulted, and under his advice the Special license had
been procured:
</p>

<p>
Yaill had written to his Brigadier and Divisional Commander....
As for Nurse Burtonshaw, she had already applied
to the Principal Commandant of the Women's Detachments
and the Matron-in-Chief at the Front for her discharge.  And
obtained it&mdash;on account of her health,&mdash;she had always been
anæmic,&mdash;and of late headache and indigestion born of
chocolate-creams and cigarettes, of which Nurse consumed
quantities when off duty, had troubled her a good deal.
</p>

<p>
"And besides, duck," she told her pal, "if it comes to
choosing between Teddy and my profession, my first duty is to
Teddy.  I do really think it was Providence prevented me
signing on for the Duration of the War!"
</p>

<p>
And so they had been married only a week ago.  O God!&mdash;O
God!&mdash;why had nothing happened to prevent the affair?
Why hadn't the officiating Church of England clergyman had
a fit or a belated attack of scruples?  Why out of all the
flotillas of aircraft scouring the charted skies on War's endless
business, had not one (preferably a bomb-carrier) crashed on
the roof of the church?
</p>

<p>
They had had breakfast at the Conronne&mdash;where Brass Hats
and Red Tabs did congregate and foregather.  In the private
room above the restaurant, looking across the short side of
the gardens across the Ouai Clemenceau.  The hotel was
crowded with British khaki and French grey puppets playing
the talky interludes that enliven the grimmest tragedy of War.
</p>

<p>
Nurse Burtonshaw had looked her best in her off-duty dress
of pale blue alpaca, with bishop sleeves, and black Red Cross
buttons, a white lawn collar and cuffs to match&mdash;a black patent
leather belt with a sprig of artificial white heather tucked in
it, and a white straw hat with the regulation Service ribbon
crowning her wonderful red-gold hair.  Her Teddy's
engagement-ring, chosen by herself, set with three smallish
rubies&mdash;did duty as keeper to the plain gold ring he had placed&mdash;not
quite an hour before&mdash;on her large, capable left hand....
</p>

<p>
The popping of corks, the clinking of glasses, and the polyglot
roar of male voices from the restaurant below, discussing
the one burning topic of the day in every civilised tongue
used on earth saving one, came to them as they ate their
omelette and sole <i>matelotte</i> at the round table in the big bay
window&mdash;looking across the Quai upon the outer Port&mdash;crammed
to the jaws of the long channel between the light-housed
jetties&mdash;with Allied steamers of all imaginable grades,
types and sizes: from Leviathan troopers, converted Cunarders
and P. and O. boats disgorging endless streams of men, horses,
lorries, guns and munitions; and Hospital ships ceaselessly
swallowing processions of walking wounded and stretcher-cases&mdash;poured
out from the long khaki-coloured Red Cross
trains drawn up at the platforms&mdash;to T.B.D.'s, British and
French mine-sweepers, submarines, American or Eastern
oil-tankers, seaplane-carriers, Wireless Service boats and
Canadian or Argentine cattle-ships.  With a myriad others brought
from the world's airts to serve this single end of War.
</p>

<p>
Lucy Burtonshaw, now Lucy Yaill,&mdash;while eating her <i>déjeuner</i>
with an unspoiled appetite, saw with relief her newly
wedded husband unmoved by this stirring spectacle; long
unfamiliar to one laid-by for months in the placid backwater of
the Convalescent Camp.  His sad grey eyes swept the
wonderful panorama without seeming to take it in.  Presently
they came back to her; and she smiled into them affectionately,
as she laid down her fork, and spared her rather large
hand, with its brand new wedding-ring under the ruby keeper,
to give his a protecting, reassuring squeeze....
</p>

<p>
"Ducks!" she cooed.  (Lucy could coo.)  "Sure all this
hasn't given you a cooker of a headache?"
</p>

<p>
He did not seem to hear.  He was looking at the sprig
of imitation white heather.  She followed the direction of
his gaze, and took it from her belt.
</p>

<p>
"That what you're looking at? ... My bit of white
heather! ... Pidge"&mdash;Pidge being the Hospital nickname of Nurse
Pringle, the pal of some pages back&mdash;"Pidge gave it me 'For
luck' when we said good-bye to each other this morning.  'Not
the real thing, but as near as I could get for two frongs!' she
said.  Want it, Ducks?"
</p>

<p>
She put in his hand Pidge's parting gift&mdash;a caricature of
Nature with its gummed green-and-white paper leaves and
bells, and trumpery glass dewdrops&mdash;and he stared at it as
though it held the secrets of the Past and of the Future
both....
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it did for Ducks.  For something wakened in him.
Some atrophied nerve vibrated, it may be: some long-numbed
brain-cell quickened into life....
</p>

<p>
Who knows what change took place? ... At any rate, the
sight and touch of the little shrub with the white-belled flower
that grows amongst the purple ling of Northern moors and
mountains, made Teddy's slowly-beating heart perform a
curious demivolt.  Remembrance began to waken from her hazy
trance, or dream, or lethargy....  Somewhere, some time,
Some One had given him a bit of white heather....  Some
One, some time, somewhere&mdash;and the gift had meant the world!
The round world floating in her ocean of air, and all the
planets swinging in their orbits....  A woman utterly,
unspeakably beloved by Nurse Burtonshaw's Teddy ... the
woman, whose love had been sweet as the honeycomb of the
Singer of the Canticles&mdash;fragrant as myrrh and ambergris and
frankincense; the utter bliss of the body&mdash;the soul's bread
and wine....
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>How beautiful are thy steps, O King's daughter! ...<br>
  How beautiful art Thou, and how comely my dearest, in delights ...<br>
  Thy stature like unto a palm-tree ... thy throat like the<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best wine ...<br>
  Put me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for love is strong as death: ... if a man should give<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the substance of his house for love he shall despise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it as nothing...</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"What are you mumbling, Teddy dear?  Sounds like a bit
out of the Bible."
</p>

<p>
He lifted his dropped head and said, regarding his wife
austerely.
</p>

<p>
"It is as a matter of fact, something from the Canticle of
Canticles.  I once got the eight of them by heart, when I
was a boy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;well! ... Don't mutter, but I thought it came out
of the Bible...."
</p>

<p>
"It does, as I said....  What are you doing?"  For Lucy
was twisting and tilting her coffee-cup, and peering into it
curiously at each new tilt or twist.
</p>

<p>
"Laying my cup&mdash;trying to read my fortune.  Though you
can't do it with coffee-grounds as well as with tea-leaves, and
even with them I'm not a patch on Pidge.  Who's Pidge, did
you ask? ... Why, Nurse Pidge, my best pal, who gave me
the bit o' white heather....  How you do stare&mdash;as though
you'd never seen me before!"
</p>

<p>
She trembled with alarm as she reached over to pat
her Teddy's cheek.  Had not Nurse Pidge, that seeress of
things to come <i>per</i> medium of "Best Household Black" or
"Liphook's Luscious Tea-Tips" prophesied truly that Nurse
Burtonshaw would reap the whirlwind over those letters in
the Japanese box....
</p>

<p>
She shivered as though a chilly draught had pierced her
blue alpaca.  Nurse Pidge had not let the topic sleep.  She
had reverted to it often in that odd <i>argot</i>,&mdash;(compound of
homely, commonplace, modern English; up-to-date scientific
terms; Public School, Clubland and Army slang),&mdash;which
comes so trippingly from the tongue of the trained nurse of
To-Day.
</p>

<p>
Pidge had quoted her idol Wyers, Oppenshaw Wyers,
F.R.C.S., of Harley Street, Lieutenant Colonel R.A.M.C. (T.),
Consulting Surgeon attached to the Staff of the Base Hospital
of which the Convalescent Camp was an offshoot.
</p>

<p>
Who has not heard of Wyers, coarse, gross and tubby in
his khaki, who showed the tenderness of an angel and the
insight of a demigod in his dealings with shell-shocked
men&mdash;victims of War's dire curse, hysteria&mdash;whose limbs and
members, flaccidly limp, or strangely twisted and distorted, refused
to obey the bidding of their owners' brains.  Who, seized by
epilepsy, would fall down foaming, or weep and sob like
heart-wrung women; or stumble in their gait and speech like the
infant members of a Kindergarten; or sit, staring vacantly,
lost in a grey dream of infinite bewilderment&mdash;as Teddy used
to sit&mdash;as Teddy was sitting now.....
</p>

<p>
"Helpless and hopeless, beyond the aid of Science, dead to
the voice or touch of old, sweet love, seemingly unhelped by
prayer.  Until&mdash;just as the stopped watch begins to tick on the
removal of some globule of oil, or speck of dust that clogged
the mechanism&mdash;the paralysed nerve thrills once more into life,
the unlocated lesion heals, the infinitesimal blood-clot
dissipates, and the man rises up, sane, freed from bonds, healed
of his infirmity."
</p>

<p>
Thus Wyers, as many other men no less great have said
before and will say after him, honestly trying to deal with
the problem that to the end of all Time will baffle the human
race: "And how or why that change takes place cannot even
be conjectured by any of us wiseacres....  Call it a Miracle
if you will,&mdash;it's as good a word as any other.  But until
that Miracle takes place&mdash;and the Angel troubles the
pool&mdash;Medicine and Surgery must twiddle their thumbs."
</p>

<p>
Were the waters moving now?  Edward Yaill's new-made
wife asked herself, timorously watching him.  When he had
spoken in that new, masterful tone&mdash;looked at her with that
new glance, so cold and keen and observant, a little shiver
had run through her underneath her blue alpaca.  The Miracle,
she knew in her soul, would spell for her Disaster.  Secretly
she must have wished that the Angel would never trouble
the pool....
</p>

<p>
The best laid plans will gang agley.  Nurse Burtonshaw,
formally relieved of her duties by ukase from the Chief Matron
on the Front in France, had quitted the Convalescent Camp
on the previous afternoon.  Two or three letters had been
brought in on Number 80's breakfast-tray that morning....
A bill from a Bond Street tailor, a communication from
Cox's Bank, London, and a square envelope of thick ribbed
linen note with the Cauldstanes postmark, addressed in a clear,
firm handwriting&mdash;a letter that would, one conjectures&mdash;but
for the interposition of Destiny,&mdash;have joined its fellows in
that Pandora casket, the Japanese Box.
</p>

<p>
Teddy, always indifferent where correspondence was concerned,
had not had time to read the letters, hurrying to tie
the Knot that takes so much undoing.  He had thrust his
mail hastily into a breast-pocket of his Service jacket&mdash;it
would well keep till by and by.  Now he fished the letters out
and laid them on the clean coarse napery of the breakfast-table,
with another envelope containing two official leaflets
badly printed on thin yellowish paper, duly stamped and <i>viséd</i>
by Military Authority, and having names and personal details
filled in with red ink.  Ensuring to Lieutenant-Colonel Edward
Angus Sholto Yaill, etc., etc., late C.O. Tweedburgh Regiment
of Infantry, Discharged from the Convalescent Hospital Camp
B&mdash;&mdash; Base, and Proceeding Home on (indefinite) Leave&mdash;as
to Lucy Alice Burtonshaw T.N. of such and such a Nursing
Detachment.  Invalided Home from Service in France under
the British Red Cross&mdash;transit at the expense of the British
Government, per steamer and rail to Folkestone, London
and Coombe Bay, Devonshire.  The passes arrested Yaill's
eye.  He did not open the letters.  He thrust them back in
his pocket; and said with a glance at the new, cheap silver
wrist-watch that had been the wedding-gift of his bride:
</p>

<p>
"We have just time to catch the boat without hurrying
you, I think, dear!"
</p>

<p>
And so they had gone out by the <i>Couronne's</i> side-entrance
to the debilitated fiacre that waited on the cobblestones in
the cold bright forenoon, and for the moment the guilty fears
that throbbed under the blue alpaca were lulled to treacherous
rest....
</p>

<p>
Old friends&mdash;these chiefly warriors going back on Blighty
leave&mdash;came up to Colonel Yaill upon the Folkestone boat,
with hearty greetings and crushing hand-grips.  Service and
Club acquaintances saluted and spoke.  People were frightfully
glad to see Yaill looking so beany, and generally tophole....
Every one was expecting soon to hear of his going back to the
Front....  Meanwhile a rest&mdash;well-earned, by the Living
Tinker!&mdash;discreetly combined with recreation, would soon set
him on his legs.  Country-house Bridge, and pillow-ragging, or
London jazz and champagne-parties only good for lieutenants....
A bit of huntin' and a pleasant house-party just the thing,
etc., what? ... Shooting and fishing had generally gone to
the dogs, all the junior keepers having been called up&mdash;but there
were woodcock and snipe and hares&mdash;that place of yours in
Cumberland must be stiff with 'em! and up North&mdash;the Gala
Water&mdash;or at a pinch&mdash;(the speaker twinkled knowingly)&mdash;the
Rushet where it ran through the Kerr's Arbour
property,&mdash;might supply a decent fish or two....
</p>

<p>
So, as the Folkestone steamer pushed through the crowded
War-traffic of the English Channel waters, chaperoned by the
dim grey shape of a T.B. destroyer,&mdash;watched from the air by
a pilot seaplane,&mdash;the desultory chatter ran on....  With a
reference or so to the War news of the month-end; the German
aircraft-raid on the Kentish coast, the Arabs of the Senussi
dispersed in West Egypt, the impending declaration of War
by Albania on Austria: winding up with a proposed adjournment
to the bar for drinks; though Government-controlled
Scotch, thirty-five under proof&mdash;and Government-brewed
malt-liquor&mdash;cursed rotten swipes&mdash;eh, what? ...
</p>

<p>
The speaker pulled himself up with a surprised glance at
the fresh-coloured young woman in the white straw hat and
the pale blue alpaca gown peeping from underneath a starred
Regulation cloak, who had laid her rather large ungloved hand
on the arm of the fellow-officer addressed, saying:
</p>

<p>
"No! ... It wouldn't be good for you! ... Please not,
Teddy!"
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, Nurse! ... I thought my friend alone.
Didn't seem to realise you'd got him on a lead.  Quite right
to give me the tip.  Colonel, the invitation's off! ... Unless
you'll pledge me in something soft; lemon-squash or
ginger-beer!&mdash;pretty rotten, I expect!&mdash;or tea, or coffee.  Perhaps
Nurse'll join?"  He thought as he screwed his eyeglasses
tighter: "<i>What glorious hair! ... My favourite colour....
Yaill strikes me as rather a lucky kind of chap!</i>" ...
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you!"  Lucy drew herself up and looked at her
husband.
</p>

<p>
With that possessive hand upon his arm, Yaill hesitated
the fraction of an instant, then took the header:
</p>

<p>
"'No thanks!' for both Mrs. Yaill and myself....  We
breakfasted rather late, didn't we, Lucy? ... Let me
introduce Major Scales-Packard, my wife...."
</p>

<p>
"Awfully delighted!"
</p>

<p>
The eyeglass of Scales-Packard, who knew Katharine
Forbis,&mdash;leaped out of its orbit as his eyebrows shot up under the
peak of his cap.  He grew red,&mdash;stammered something
congratulatory, saluted and speedily vanished.  And Lucy breathed
more freely.  Dimly she sensed that she had stepped across
the frontiers of a new, and possibly hostile country.  That
man, Teddy's friend, had looked at her&mdash;when Teddy had
introduced him,&mdash;as though she had been guilty of child-stealing....
</p>

<p>
Had she? ... The question probed to the quick, so that she
paled and shivered; and found relief in the solicitude her
convalescent displayed: permitting Teddy in his new role of
guardian and protector, to envelop her in plaids and waterproofs,
to find her a seat upon the smutty leeward side of the grimy
after-deck saloon-cabin&mdash;and supply her with Captain's biscuits
and tea, both of War's villainous brand.  Her mental qualms
would have been justified had she overheard Scales-Packard
confiding to numerous acquaintances on board:
</p>

<p>
"See that tall, good-lookin' man with a blue Hospital
brassard? ... That's Yaill, late C.O. of the Tweedburgh
Regiment!  Gassed and shell-shocked last September
somewhere north of Loos....  Married his nurse at the Base
C.O.C. and comin' home&mdash;poor silly blighter!&mdash;to break it to
the finest woman God ever made&mdash;who's waited for him years
and years."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0215"></a></p>

<h3>
XV
</h3>

<p>
There had been&mdash;Yaill remembered, staring into the red-gold
heart of the fire, where sapphire and violet and emerald flames
played over the burning turfs and hissing oaken billets, making
as they devoured them a little purring sound;&mdash;there had
been a little hitch over baggage when they got to Folkestone.
Two heavy strapped cowhide trunks, recovered from Regimental
Headquarters; now found to be lacking some necessary
red or blue chalk lettering,&mdash;were nearly being shipped back
to the Base.  Battered, mildewed, smeared with whitewash,
they presented a deplorable appearance on the truck with
Teddy's brand new Gladstone, (War manufacture, of American
cloth masquerading as leather) and Lucy's green
canvas-covered box.
</p>

<p>
The keys of the trunks had long been lost,&mdash;necessitating
an explanation with the Representative of Customs.  But Yaill
had needed nothing that those leather trunks might contain
during the three days they had spent in London, on the third
floor of a vast caravanserai of a hotel, looking on the
myriad-voiced Strand.  But he had sent for a locksmith on the second
day, and had fresh keys fitted.  And on the morning subsequent
to the arrival of the bride and bridegroom at the Tor
View Hotel, Coombe Bay, he had gone into the dressing-room
adjacent to their nuptial chamber, fresh from his bath,
rumpled as to the hair,&mdash;and opened one of the battered
receptacles in search of a khaki tie.  Quite haphazard, and as
chance would have it&mdash;on the top&mdash;between a mouldy Field
Service mess-frock, and some khaki shirts with burnt holes in
them made by red-hot shell-splinters&mdash;he had found a
silver-mounted leather photograph-frame, much tarnished, and gone
white in spots....
</p>

<p>
The frame held a portrait of large panel-size, and at the
back was a strut to stand it up by.  He lifted the frame and
set it up against the lid of the open trunk, on the top of the
mouldy clothes, and Ah!&mdash;what a warm, rich, fragrant gale of
memories blew through the man's sick brain and desolate
heart as those dear eyes of Katharine's looked candid love into
his own!  Something like a cry escaped him&mdash;he choked it
back fiercely....
</p>

<p>
"Did you call me, Teddy?" asked his wife from the next
room, where she sat in a blue Japanese kimono, brushing her
wonderful red-gold hair before a modest display of
nickel-silver-backed brushes and toilet-bottles.  For through the
partly-closed door of the dressing-room, or so it seemed to Lucy,
she had heard a woman's name....  And to Lucy's Nonconformist
mind, the woman a man cries out for must be his
lawful married helpmeet; and if she isn't, then the wife has
got a (legal, mind you!) right to know the reason why....
"Did you want me, dear?" she reiterated,&mdash;and saw reflected
in the toilette-glass behind her blue kimono-covered shoulders
and round fresh country face&mdash;from which the bloom had
faded suddenly,&mdash;the half-open door of the dressing-room
close softly, and heard the key turn in the lock upon the
other side....
</p>

<p>
The chambermaid came through with Yaill's shaving-water,
and said that the bath was ready for the lady; and Lucy went
at once.  Purposely prolonging her matutinal ablutions, so that
Teddy had dressed and gone down to the coffee-room by the
time she returned, much more composed in mind....
</p>

<p>
When she came down the wide shallow staircase with its
artificial palms in mock-bronze vessels, and British-made
Turkey carpet,&mdash;he was waiting for her there....  The manager,
an alleged Swiss, had given them a table in the window,
and&mdash;sensing the honeymooners with the infallible instinct of his
tribe&mdash;enclosed it with lincrusta screens&mdash;and placed by each
cover a sprig of white heather of the artificial kind.  It is
strange how Fate and Destiny, twin-balances of the scales in
which poor human lives are weighed, will be tipped one way
or the other by gewgaws such as this....
</p>

<p>
Within the glass of the photo-frame, against the knee of
the tall, erect, womanly-gracious figure, was a withered sprig
of the real white heather, plucked on the moors above Kerr's
Arbour, and placed there by Katharine....  Against the
raging heart of Yaill lay Katharine's latest letter....  He had
found it on the dressing-glass with the notification from Cox's
Bank, and the Bond Street tailor's bill.
</p>

<p>
He knew that letter word for word.  He saw the short,
poignant sentences in the beloved handwriting written on the
walls of the coffee-room, across the imitation-tapestry paper;
on the white tablecloth and serviettes; on the alleged Swiss
manager's badly-starched shirt-front, and smug dingy-pale
face.
</p>

<p>
He refused ham and eggs; broke War-bread toast, and
drank down cup after cup of doubtful coffee, unseen by Lucy,
who was fluttered by the observant lorgnette of a large lady,
breakfasting with one obese elderly gentleman in the silver-grey
of the Local Coast Defence Corps&mdash;and two tanned young
men in khaki with shabby Sam Browne belts and sword-straps,
sufficiently like the large lady, to be, as in fact they were,
her sons....
</p>

<p>
Now the large important lady&mdash;upon the shoulder-straps
of whose blue serge jacket glittered the four-pointed gold star
of a Commandant above the numeral of the Detachment&mdash;the
honoured title of the Red Cross Society and the name of
her County&mdash;happened to be Lady Ridgely, Commandant of
a Convalescent Hospital for Private Soldiers, a large white
mansion standing in neatly-kept grounds, above the Tor View
Hotel, on the same side of the Torcliff Road....  For certain
reasons of her own Lady Ridgely had taken to breakfasting
at the Tor View Hotel; and being a rigid martinet <i>re</i> the
observance of Regulations, the sight of Lucy's pale-blue alpaca
Foreign Service Off Duty dress had very much shocked her,&mdash;worn
in combination with an officer so manifestly an invalid:
"For even without his Hospital brassard, which he must have
forgotten to take off&mdash;the man looked simply ghastly, my
dear!"
</p>

<p>
Thus Lady Ridgely afterwards, per telephone, (the receiver
being held by her sister-in-law, the Deputy-Assistant
Director-General of the L.L.W.S.L. at the London Headquarters)&mdash;and
a cousin, as Fate would have it, of the protagonist.  Of
whom Lady Ridgely took no note at first, being wholly
absorbed in the blue alpaca&mdash;and not unconscious of the fact
that its wearer was embarrassed by the rigid glare of her
lorgnetted eye.
</p>

<p>
When at length she lowered the instrument, it was to
signal the Coffee-Room Manager, alleged Swiss, who hurried
to her side....
</p>

<p>
"Kindly tell me the names of those two persons breakfasting
at the table in the window.  The invalid officer and the pale
blue nurse," commanded Lady Ridgely.  And the alleged Swiss
Manager of the Coffee-Room, relieved&mdash;for very private
reasons, to find another than himself the object of Lady Ridgely's
lorgnette&mdash;bounded away to consult the Visitor's Book in the
vestibule-office&mdash;returned with the information, was thanked,
and gratefully effaced himself.  Subsequently interned under
the Defence Of The Realm Act, upon conviction of communication
by flashlight with certain undersea activities in the
Channel&mdash;we are to see his pasty German face no more.
</p>

<p>
The dreary meal came to an end.  When his wife rose,
Yaill went with her to the staircase-foot and said in a quiet,
level tone:
</p>

<p>
"You were so&mdash;kind as to put some letters of mine away
in a box for me....  Might I ask you to be so good as to let
me have them now?"
</p>

<p>
She tried, poor goose!&mdash;a mingling of self-assertion and
coquetry:
</p>

<p>
"Give 'em you now? ... I like that tone of yours....
Now that we're married and one flesh ... I'm not at all so
sure I shall!"
</p>

<p>
He looked her full in the eyes and said to her quietly:
</p>

<p>
"You will go upstairs to our&mdash;to your room,&mdash;and bring
them to me here!"
</p>

<p>
"Will I? ... Oh! well,&mdash;I suppose I must, since you're so
set on it."
</p>

<p>
She dropped her head like a sulky child, and mounted the
wide stairs slowly.  Yaill stood at the stairfoot watching, while
the blue alpaca was in sight.  She did not return.  He followed,
and knocked at the door of their bedroom.  She cried "Come
in" and he went in, to find her with a tear-stained, sulky, mulish
face, standing at the bedside....  The Japanese workbox&mdash;a
tawdry thing of imitation lacquer&mdash;was lying on the counterpane.
She gulped to him that she had mislaid the key that
opened the stupid thing.  He responded:
</p>

<p>
"Break open the box.  I will buy you&mdash;others!"
</p>

<p>
"My hands aren't strong enough!"
</p>

<p>
She feigned that those broad, strong dairywoman's hands
that had put up many a twelve-pound frail of muslin-enwrapped
pats for the market,&mdash;that had held down delirious men upon
their Hospital beds&mdash;were too feeble to break the flimsy lock
of Japanese manufacture.  He accepted her explanation with
unmoved countenance.
</p>

<p>
"Then be good enough to allow me!"
</p>

<p>
The letters were in his hands.  But even as they poured forth
from their camphor-scented prison, so from his wife's swollen,
trembling mouth poured a stream of wordy defence.  He
could hear the voice pleading now with its broad, soft
Somerset accent....
</p>

<p>
"How was I to be sure she told the truth? ... And didn't
she ask me&mdash;and didn't you too&mdash;to put by the letters? ... Haven't
I said to you over and over, when you swore how
much you loved me.  '<i>Tell me, Teddy, on your oath!  Are you
sure you're not engaged?</i>'&mdash;And you always swore you weren't,
and that till you met me you'd never known what it meant to
love any woman!  Am I to be blamed&mdash;called wicked and
treacherous&mdash;because I believed you?  Oh, Ted!"
</p>

<p>
He had ground his heel into the carpet beneath his feet, and
set his teeth to keep back the curses he longed to shriek at
her.  That plump, fresh-coloured, well-proportioned,
deadly-commonplace young woman would never know what
murderous frenzy boiled in her Teddy's blood, and tautened his
muscles then.  But he crushed down the ugly, murderous
impulse and said to her with elaborate gentleness:
</p>

<p>
"I do not blame you....  I have not reproached you
with&mdash;anything.  And&mdash;I have spoiled your box, and you were fond
of it.  You shall have one ten times as good as soon as they
can send it from Liberty's."
</p>

<p>
So, with the promise of a new box instead of the smashed
one, he carried away his letters, and went up on the moors
where he might be alone to read....  And the larks were
singing in the pale harebell skies of late January....  And the
spicy smell of the larches, the raw-red trunks of the pines, and
the rasp of the wintry ling underfoot reminded him of
Scotland.  And the rust-brown of the frost-nipped bracken was
the shade of Katharine's hair.  And the colour of the little
streams, running crystal-bright over dead drowned leaves and
red-brown Devon sandstone had the very, very colour of
those beloved eyes....  Stars that would never now look
down upon the slumber of their child....
</p>

<p>
To Wyers of Harley Street, Lieutenant-Colonel (T) R.A.M.C.,
Consulting Surgeon attached to the Staff of the Base
Hospital in connection with the Convalescent Camp at B&mdash;&mdash;
the Chief Medical Officer, was at that moment saying&mdash;Wyers
having just returned by 'plane from a professional visit to
the Front:
</p>

<p>
"You know Yaill left us for Blighty on Tuesday morning?
I'm wondering whether it wouldn't have been better to have
kept him on here a bit?  Or have sent him to that Hydro at
Les Bonnes Eaux."
</p>

<p>
"Instead&mdash;"  Wyers flicked off the ash of his inevitable
Trichinopoli, and deftly picked up a little sheaf of papers
clipped together from the big leather-topped writing-table in
the C.M.O.'s official room.  He reversed the chart, to glance
with cool professional interest at the history-sheet behind it,
and turned back to the doctor's card with the inky scrawl
beneath the heading:
</p>

<p>
"Discharged....  Convalescent" ... and the date of three
days back.
</p>

<p>
"Instead of striking him off the sheet with leave to get
married!  I don't see why not, for my part.  He's as well as
ever he will be, unless&mdash;you know my theory!  And marriage
may help him.  Should, certainly&mdash;supposing him to have got
hold of a woman of the right sort."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but has he?  Query,&mdash;is she?"  The Chief Medical
Officer, deftly packing fragrant Navy Cut into a well-burned
briar-root, looked up from his deft thumb-work, under an
anxiously-puckered brow.  "You're not aware that he's
married the chart-nurse of No. 8. Hut Ward C.O.C.  That little
Burtonshaw&mdash;you remember Burtonshaw?  Blonde and blue-eyed,
faintly frisky, but a model of provincial propriety for
all of that.  And a good nurse&mdash;to do her justice!&mdash;now
discharged invalided, after two years' Foreign Service with her
unit of the Red Cross."
</p>

<p>
"H'm!"  The nod of Wyers conveyed his knowledge of
Nurse Burtonshaw.  "There's only one thing to say for a
match of that kind.  It may turn out successfully.  One hopes
of course it will.  But for a man of that stamp&mdash;ultra refined,
highly-bred, and used&mdash;going by what one has heard&mdash;"
whatever Wyers had heard, he retained with Sphinx-like
taciturnity,&mdash;"to a very different type of woman,&mdash;Happiness will
not depend on his ultimate return to the normal,&mdash;do you
follow?  But on his stopping exactly where he is.  For the
Miracle wouldn't benefit him&mdash;under the present circumstances.
Better for him that the Angel should never trouble
the pool!"
</p>

<p>
Thus Oppenshaw Wyers, who may or may not have heard
the name of Katharine Forbis.  But the Miracle had happened,
Yaill had returned to the normal....  And the thin
chance of happiness in an unequal union with the poor thing
he had married&mdash;lay shattered into fragments at his unlucky
feet.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sitting on a crumbling ledge of the grey-pink cliffs of Devon,
he read his love's letters&mdash;that had come so much too late.
Such fond womanly letters&mdash;and gallant and courageous,
written from her Receiving Hospital in France, and from the
Base&mdash;and from a London Nursing Home and from Kerr's
Arbour.
</p>

<p>
Here was one dated from the Receiving Hospital in
Belgium in the previous April.  It shall be quoted here:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY MAN OF ALL MEN....
</p>

<p>
"To-day I met a Tommy (one of a great many) on the
frightfully muddy road that leads from Our Shop to the
fighting-line.  We were bringing down wounded&mdash;(Canadians
chiefly).  This long-legged, gaunt, black-a-vised man was
going up with the Relief.  A Jew unmistakably&mdash;going by his
leading feature&mdash;and in evident trouble about a chum who had
got crumped.  So your Kathy, wangling a spare seat from
under an orderly&mdash;undertook to convey Private Abrahams'
chum back to Hospital...."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Added some hours later:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"There isn't so much wrong&mdash;and I'm going to drop a postcard
to Abrahams in the Support trenches, to tell him so and
cheer his heart.  The queer thing about it is&mdash;that the
moment I saw Abrahams&mdash;(whose real name is Hazel)&mdash;I
felt I knew the man! ... Somewhere, his huge hooked
beak and great shoulders have risen up before me.  Somehow&mdash;this
can't be love at first sight, Edward!"  Ah, wicked
Katharine!&mdash;"because my heart is so hopelessly lost to
you!&mdash;somehow his very ordinary&mdash;rather Cockney voice wasn't
quite the voice of a stranger.  Oddly I felt that I could trust
the man!&mdash;had trusted him&mdash;somewhere, in many a tight
place! ... Newspaper has come in....  Must stop here....
Finish this idiotic epistle to-night when I get a chance&mdash;"
</p>

"MY PRECIOUS DEAR,

<p>
"I've had your last letter.  So you're lonely wanting your
Katharine!  My dear, don't be!  I AM with you, though not
bodily&mdash;yet in heart and soul.  Please God&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a break.  The handwriting of the rest was shaky
and irregular, showing what storms of mingled emotions had
swept through the writer.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"This was begun the day before yesterday.  I left off to
read the News of the War.  Read&mdash;Oh! my dearest&mdash;with
what mingled joy and anguish, the story of the combined
assault on Loos.  My love, my love!&mdash;what awful loss!  How
you must grieve for your glorious regiment!  Thanks to Our
Lord and His dear Mother! you are alive!&mdash;you are alive!
The report that you were missing was contradicted in a later
bulletin.  I've been crying until I'm hideous, for sorrow and
joy and pride in you, my Edward!  And, for gratitude that
you're alive&mdash;and longing to be with you....  How I should
love to pitch duty to the wide and rush away to nurse You!
Wouldn't I?  WOULDN'T I?&mdash;if it were only playing the game.
But I must,&mdash;MUST stop here and do my job for the Red
Cross.  My own Edward&mdash;these silly X's are all meant for
kisses....  The blots are where I've cried! ... Oh! how
I've cried&mdash;how I would love to cry all over the shoulder of
your dear khaki jacket.  With love and such unutterable pride
in my dear lover&mdash;Your own for this world and the next,
please Heaven!  Katharine."

The third bore a date in October, 1916, and the address of
a Distributing Hospital on a Base in France.

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAREST DEAR,
</p>

<p>
"I've been desperately wretched, writing and WRITING and
never getting a scrap from you.  Now comes a letter written
by your nurse.  She tells me that your dear eyes can't stand
print or handwriting, and that even being read to is dreadful
agony.  Edward, how selfish I have been&mdash;and how stupid,
with all my experience of the results of shell-shock&mdash;not to
realise the extent and nature of my dear one's suffering!  Now
I beg and command you never to dream of writing until you
are fit to!  I have asked your kind nurse not even to read you
my letters, until you are able to hear them without distress or
pain.  To think that loving lines from me should cause you
suffering, Edward!  And yet I understand, my own! how such
a condition may exist.  For the moment I leave off.  They
are beating the gong and some signal rockets have just
warned us&mdash;"

"An attack by German bomb-carrying Taubes on the Hospital,
in spite of air-scouts and L&mdash;&mdash;s barrage of
anti-aircraft guns.  There is a British Army Corps H.Q. close by.
I try to think they wanted that&mdash;and not really to bomb the
Hospital with all those poor, poor bandaged men helpless in
their beds.
</p>

<p>
It was terrific.  They got us with H.E. every time&mdash;and
the Hospital looks like a squashed bandbox.  But, you see, in
spite of the Boche's worst, your loving Kathy stays alive.
Casualties only three, thank God!  A convalescent Tommy
killed, an R.A.M.C. orderly badly wounded; and a
V.A.D. ambulance-driving woman somehow got an internal
injury&mdash;helping to carry some of the worst cases out of the blazing
wards down into the cellars of the Commandant's
house&mdash;luckily close by.

Be prepared to find my next letter written from London,

'<i>Hospital of SS. Stanislaus and Theresa, Copse End Road,
St. John's Wood.  Care of the Matron.</i>'  Don't worry the least
bit! ... I'm tophole, though no good for driving.  It

good&mdash;" crossed out&mdash;"He is, has He not saved you, Edward?&mdash;I
shall come rushing over to B&mdash;&mdash; and carry you home.
Home to Scotland.  Oh, my dear, what it would be to have you
to myself at Kerr's Arbour!  All the memories of our happy
days langsyne are waiting for us, Edward,&mdash;under the blessed
old roof-beams, and on the moors and in the fir-wood&mdash;(miles
of bluebells, you remember, in May&mdash;growing under the
black-green trees)&mdash;and where wee Rushet winds away
between the green braesides, to tumble into Teviot.  I've still got
some of the primroses we gathered there one April.  Oh! the
good times, before the dreadful War.  Let us both look
forward steadily, and hope, and pray, Edward,&mdash;that they may
come again.  If this is a dismal letter, forgive:

</p>

<p>
"The operation&mdash;quite a small affair, happily over, and your
Kathy pronounced to be well upon the mend.  I get the best of
care at this dear place, where matron and Sisters spoil me.
Everybody in town is overwhelmingly kind, and if I set down
all the messages of affection and goodwill that I am charged
with for you, and repeated all the admiring speeches that have
been made to me about my sweetheart&mdash;I should need half-a-dozen
sheets of letter-paper to write to you instead of one.
</p>

<p>
"Are you able to read for yourself a little, dearest, or do
you still depend on the kind offices of your nurse?  If the
answer is 'Yes' to my question, she has of course given you
my letters.  I have her assurance that she will do this on the
very earliest opportunity.  For I should not like her to read
them to you, you know, Edward!  For one thing, my epistolary
style is open to criticism&mdash;and for another&mdash;what I set
down for your dear eyes was and will always be meant for no
other's.  Ah, but you understand!
</p>

<p>
"This is a dull scribble.  But I'll do better next time.  Too
tired to write another.  God bless you, darling!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
K. F.
</p>

<p>
"If only you could write! ... I'm hungering for a line
so.  But not&mdash;not a scratch&mdash;if it's bad for you, my own!
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"K."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There were many letters, and Yaill read them all, haphazard
at first, and then in regular sequence, down to the
very last....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"KERR'S ARBOUR, TWEEDBURGH, N.B.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>January 20th.</i>
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Edward, can't you write, my darling?  Your
nurse sends me news of your wonderful improvement, for
which I thank God, with all my heart and soul!  But if you
are so much better that you can read without pain and
endure being read to, why not a scrap of a line to me? ... It
seems to me that I have some right, forgive me for reminding
you, to have news of you from your own hand, my dearest
one....  Oh! to have to beg the bread of one's heart....
I was proud once&mdash;men used to say so.  Now I am only your
very lonely, horribly unhappy KATHARINE."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And yet until a door had clicked open in Yaill's brain, that
handwriting had meant nothing.  He asked his Maker in the
depths of his wrung soul, why that Open Sesame of the bit
of white heather&mdash;why the leather baggage-trunk with its
guarded secret,&mdash;why the letter with its cry of wounded
passion had come to the man who loved Katharine, too late?
</p>

<p>
"<i>It seems to me that I have some right....</i>"  Proud,
delicate-minded Katharine.  What suffering must have wrung
that sad reproach from her, that cry of a wounded soul....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oh! to have to beg the bread of one's heart....  I way
proud once&mdash;men used to say so.  Now I am only your very
lonely, horribly unhappy Katharine.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Lonely....  Unhappy, his joy, his treasure, his worshipped
one....  Well, Yaill would go to her now, though Hell's gulf
yawned between.  He had had this in his mind when he passed
up the cliff-road, breathing the unheeded spices of the sea and
the pine-trees, with the warm morning sunshine full upon
his back....
</p>

<p>
Now, sitting high upon the cliffs with the booming of the
Channel waters in his ears and the mourning cry of the hovering
gulls about him, he faced a dim crimson sun, going to bed
in blankets of grey fog.  The letters lay scattered on the
grass between his feet.  He gathered them up and buttoned
them away safely in his pockets.  Then he got up and went
back to his wife at the Tor View Hotel.
</p>

<p>
He would say he had been called away on business.  She
must stay there&mdash;the woman who bore his name, until he
had seen his lawyers....  He would provide for her
generously.  Things would be arranged, he told himself as he
hurried down the cliff-road in the clammy, blanketing fog....
</p>

<p>
The excuses were not received as easily as he had anticipated.
He had left a sulky, tearful girl alone the whole day.
And he came back to a resentful, jealous woman....
</p>

<p>
He shuddered, remembering how he had bowed his head to
meet the storm of reproach.
</p>

<p>
Well, well!  Forget,&mdash;now one was here under the dear roof
of Kerr's Arbour, by the warm side of the beloved&mdash;the
perfect, the ideal mate.  He looked at her as she sat there by his
side with her proud head bent, and the dark fringes of her
dreaming eyes lowered upon the soft blush that graced her
cheeks,&mdash;Love's exquisite carnation flag, always displayed for
Edward.
</p>

<p>
She was happy, poor, faithful soul, with just a little tang
of guilt spoiling the happiness.  Mark had been killed at
Mons, and Julian had been gulped down by the insatiable
War-monster; and Death had taken their father and hers,
but her man of men was left.  How could she help, by his
dear side, being a little happy?  She turned and gave him
look for look, and his strength began to ebb away.
</p>

<p>
Yaill's determination to play the game fairly was weakening.
The barriers were breaking down.  His tense muscles twitched,
his blood ran liquid fire.  In another moment he would have
snatched her to him, stifled her surprise with furious
kisses&mdash;assailed her virgin ears with frantic pleadings&mdash;but that a
bell clanged at the hallward end of the corridor.  Whishaw's
asthmatic cough sounded outside,&mdash;he knocked and came in.
</p>

<p>
The old man's lean figure, with its stooping, rook-like gait,
was invested with new, dignified solemnity, his well-worn
blacks, even the wide-flanged Gladstone collar that framed his
frosty-apple chops, and the rusty-black silk neckerchief
knotted under his chin, the short end sticking out at a perennial
right-angle, while the other flowed over his starchless shirt-front,
to lose itself in the hollows of his baggy waistcoat,&mdash;were
as vestments of one readied for some sacerdotal rite.
He carried a three-branched silver candlestick of antique form,
with lighted wax-tapers, and a Missal bound in faded crimson
leather was tucked under his other arm....
</p>

<p>
"Ye'll be for the nicht-prayers noo, Miss Forbis?  The
Father has gane ben the chap<i>ell</i>, sae I juist bode to ring the
bell."
</p>

<p>
"We are coming now, Whishaw."
</p>

<p>
Katharine rose, took a folded black lace veil from the corner
of the mantelshelf, shook out its scrolled and patterned length&mdash;with
firelight flashing through the dark transparency, draped it
with one swift upward movement, over her noble head&mdash;and
held out a hand to Yaill.  He cursed the intruder mentally as
he got up and the warm fingers met his own&mdash;because those
wild words surging to his lips had been so baulked of
utterance.  But he took the Missal Whishaw offered him, and led
his love out and down the long corridor&mdash;following the lean,
black figure with its upheld light over the flagged pavement,
whose uneven stones could be felt through thickness of matting
and worn Turkey carpeting.
</p>

<p>
Whishaw held open the Chapel door, Katharine passed in
and Yaill followed mechanically; conscious as might be a man
in a dream, of the mingled perfume of incense and flowers, of
the hollow square of benches in the little nave, framing the
long coffin on its black-draped trestles, with the tall brown wax
tapers in their man-high wooden candlesticks burning at the
head, and the sides, and the feet....
</p>

<p>
Still as in a dream he bent his knee as Katharine sank down
before the Presence in the Tabernacle, and rose up from her
genuflection to take his hand again.  He felt her lead him
up the narrow aisle ... heard her say to that strange,
familiar face, young-old, wax-white, framed in the shining
oaken wood against the background of the narrow pillow:
</p>

<p>
"Dear Father, Edward has come."
</p>

<p>
And he knew as he looked on the still face of the old man,
guardian even in Death of his House's honour&mdash;that those
traitorous words that had been upon his tongue would never
be spoken now.

<p><a id="chap0216"></a></p>

<h3>
XVI
</h3>

<p>
Katharine said to him next morning as they sat together at
breakfast:
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to hear of a good night's sleep.  I fancied that
you would rest better in your old bedroom, dear."
</p>

<p>
Yaill said, rejoicing in the clear sparkle of her eyes, the
fresh, sweet tinting of her cheeks, the gloss upon her springy
hair, and the dozen other charming signs that proved her an
early-morning woman:
</p>

<p>
"You knew that I should prefer my langsyne nest of
old-fashioned rosebud-chintz to any other.  When I went inside
and shut the door, all the old memories came crowding round
me.  The great carved four-post bed, the big blaze in the
bowed Queen Anne grate, the General's arm-chair opposite
mine&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where he always sat, dear love! to smoke that last
good-night-cigar, that seemed to have no end."  She blinked back a
tear resolutely and Yaill said, feeling in the side-pocket of his
Field Service jacket:
</p>

<p>
"Here is something I found last night on the chintz-room
chimney-piece."  He displayed a blackened briar-root pipe
with the initials E.A.Y. engraved on its tarnished silver
mounting.  "The first birthday-present I ever had from you.
And in the camphor-wood William and Mary press"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Your dear, shabby old shooting-suit.  Lying there ever
since August, 1914."
</p>

<p>
Men know so little even of the women they love.  He never
dreamed of the kisses and tears, the wild words whispered,
the secrets told to that belted Norfolk-jacket of rough tweed,
smelling of cigars and heather.  Breakfast over, he filled the
briar-root and went to smoke it on the terrace, while after
conference with the housekeeper, and a brief visit to
Mrs. Bell, who breakfasted in her bedroom, Katharine tied on a
vast apron of blue and white checked cotton, covered her head
with her black lace veil, and went to renew the Altar flowers,
replace the burnt-out brown-wax tapers&mdash;and sweep and dust
the Sanctuary.
</p>

<p>
Her doubly-sacred duties done, and the prayer that followed
ended, her heart flew back to Edward, and she went whither
it tugged.  He was pacing, bareheaded, on the gravel of the
lavender-walk below the flagstoned terrace that ran before the
drawing-room windows.  His pipe was gripped askew between
his teeth,&mdash;his hands were driven deep into his breeches-pockets.
The frozen lavender-bushes were not greyer or
dourer than his face....
</p>

<p>
"<i>You dear! ... You dear! ... Come here! ...</i>"
</p>

<p>
She imitated the blackbird's challenging Spring call, a
quaintly pretty gift of hers; and he looked up and took his
pipe out of his mouth, and his wintry face was gone&mdash;and it
was Spring.  He smiled and beckoned, and she hoisted her
carnation flag,&mdash;unlatched the French window and was
stepping out to join him,&mdash;when Whishaw's voice said behind
her:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Forbis, mem, there is a gentleman&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman, Whishaw!  But, of course, you mean Mr. Keller."
</p>

<p>
"I'm no!" Whishaw retorted.  "I'm no' meaning the lawyer-body!"
</p>

<p>
"But I can receive no visitor!  At a time like this..."
</p>

<p>
Miss Forbis' dismay rang in her tones.  Her dark brows
straightened.  Her mouth hardened a little as she turned to
confront her servitor:
</p>

<p>
"I'm no' saying stric'ly a veesitor," Whishaw amended:
"A caller I'se ca' the body&mdash;gin need's be ca' him onything."  As
Whishaw showed a card upon a Benares silversalver, his
red-rimmed old eyes blinked, and his frosty-apple visage
assumed an expression of scandalised dismay.  "I'm sair loth
to bring my mistress sic' a message, an' the General's corp
lying in the chap<i>ell</i>&mdash;an' the Funeral on Monday,&mdash;and yoursel'
an' the Colonel set mourning by a maisterless hairth!  But
the big, black lad in khaki that rode oot on Alec Govan's
motor-cycle frae Cauldstanes the morn's morn, is deid set on
winnin' an answer from ye....  He says&mdash;an' Gude kens!&mdash;for
a' his medal an' his wound-stripes, the man may be
lying!&mdash;that ye're prepared to see him, an' hear what he has
to say!"  He added: "An' I'm boun' to testify, gin he's nae
respeckitable the dougs are deceivit; for Bran an' Laddie an'
Dawtie are fell freendly wi' the man."
</p>

<p>
Yaill had approached the drawing-room window, by the
steps leading up to the terrace from the lavender-walk.  He
had heard, and his heart contracted in a spasm of fierce
suspicion, and his brows drew down over narrowed, glittering
eyes.  He watched the face of Katharine as she pondered
over the card of the intruder.  It at first occurred to him that
the stranger had ridden over from Whingates with a note from
Lady Wastwood, telling all.  He had no sooner dismissed the
idea than another took the place of it.  That woman, whom he
had left at Coombe Bay, had somehow discovered his
destination.  From her&mdash;and from no other&mdash;this urgent stranger
came....
</p>

<p>
"You will not think of seeing the fellow, Katharine? ... Under
the circumstances you might very well decline." ...
</p>

<p>
His voice, sounding strange in his own ears, brought
Katharine's head round, and called her absorbed eyes back to his
beloved face.  She said, as Whishaw clacked his tongue
noisily against his palate, and fidgeted from one gouty foot to
another:
</p>

<p>
"The name upon this card was familiar to my father.  He
told me some weeks before his death, that he looked forward
with great interest to the coming of a Mr. Hazel&mdash;I suppose
the Mr. John Benn Hazel of the firm of Dannahill, Lee-Levyson
and Hazel, Insurance Brokers, of Cornhill&mdash;London&mdash;whose
name is on this card....  I know it was his intention
to offer Mr. Hazel hospitality.  His family&mdash;I am told they are
Jews of Palestine&mdash;has been for more years than I dare to
estimate&mdash;closely associated with our own....  He has a
right&mdash;should he wish to exercise it&mdash;to attend my father's
funeral.  Should he even ask to see him&mdash;I should not venture
to refuse."
</p>

<p>
Whishaw said, straightening his stooping back to soldierly
erectness, and holding the Benares tray against the seam of
his trouser-leg:
</p>

<p>
"Vera' gude, Miss Forbis, mem.  Will I bring Mr. Hazel
here to ye, or show him in the morning parlour?  'My business
wi' the leddy,' says he, 'is maist private, ye ken.'"
</p>

<p>
Katharine's order to show the visitor into the morning
parlour was forestalled by Yaill's saying:
</p>

<p>
"Receive Mr. Hazel here.  While you talk to him I shall
smoke another pipe in the garden, if I may?" ...
</p>

<p>
He hardly gave back the smile that accompanied Katharine's
assent.  She untied her blue apron and laid aside her
veil.  Yaill touched her hand swiftly with his lips, and went
out again into the frosty morning sunshine, as Whishaw
quitted the drawing-room, clacking softly yet....
</p>

<p>
The door re-opened, showing his black, rook-like shape,
bald brow, sharp, little red-rimmed blue eyes, and
withered-apple-visage, plimmed into an expression of sour disapproval,
behind the vast khaki shoulders of a huge man who stooped
low upon the room's threshold, saluting its mistress with
almost Oriental reverence....
</p>

<p>
If the accompanying words had been: "Hail to you, O
lady!" instead of "I'm glad to have the pleasure&mdash;" as John
Hazel bent his gaunt shoulders and lowered his square black
head before the tall, womanly shape that towered against its
sunlit background of terrace and garden, woodlands and
snow-tipped hills, Miss Forbis would hardly have been surprised.
For his long right arm had shot out and downwards, sweeping
back with the fingers incurved, to touch breast and lips and
forehead.  As he rose up to his great height of six feet four
inches, and some invisible, resistless hand&mdash;with the weight of
many centuries behind it&mdash;ceased to press down his head&mdash;the
glamour of his Eastern salutation fell from him like a
discarded robe....
</p>

<p>
Katharine saw a big, raw-boned, brown-skinned man, of
powerfully Semitic type, probably a year or two over thirty;
too gaunt to be coarse, and too frankly middle-class in tone
and manner to be mistaken for a gentleman.  And
somewhere&mdash;somewhere&mdash;she had met the man before....
</p>

<p>
To John as Whishaw closed the drawing-room door and its
owner moved forward with graceful, gracious greeting, the
first sight of Katharine brought its disappointing shock.  For
it was not the woman he had unreasonably expected.  Taller&mdash;he
had only seen the Ideal seated, remember!  Older, with
great, sad eyes, rust-coloured as the withered leaves,
surrounded with brownish circles.  The rich carnations that had
bloomed in the other woman's cheeks, under the peaked blue
cloth storm-cap of Foreign Service, were missing.  It was not
she, but a woman who was like her!  Extremely like her,&mdash;John
conceded that.  But older, paler, graver and more
self-contained; without the gay good-fellowship, the heartening
smile&mdash;the buoyancy&mdash;the atmosphere of youth....
</p>

<p>
And yet, as he stood by the chair to which she had pointed,
waiting impassively until she should have chosen and taken
her own seat, he knew that he stood in the presence of his
very liege lady, whom by virtue of an ancient oath one John
Hazel was bound to serve, honour, reverence, defend and
obey....
</p>

<p>
He said to himself that he was glad the real Katharine Forbis
was older than <i>that other</i>.  More dignified, more reserved,
and all that sort of thing.  He was saying it again when the
tall shape of a man in khaki passed the open window on his
left hand,&mdash;there were four of these opening like doors on a
level with the terrace&mdash;and a red spark kindled in John's
gaunt black eyes,&mdash;because he knew the man again.  He would
deal with him presently.  Meanwhile&mdash;he looked back at Miss
Forbis, and roughly caught his breath.  Who had deemed
her less than young, with such eyes of gold and bramble-dew,
and such roses blooming in her cheeks, as her wide, beautiful
mouth curved in a happy smile.  And that she WAS the Woman
of the muddy road that had led in April, 1915, to the Fighting
Line east of Ypres&mdash;there could be no doubt....
</p>

<p>
"Then it <i>is</i> you!"&mdash;broke from him....  "I give you my
word that hundreds of times since that day on the Menin
road, I've said to myself I'd know you again anywhere&mdash;even
if they'd shown me your skin on a gate!  But&mdash;up to this
minute I've not been sure.  Now I'm certain!"
</p>

<p>
In the same breath she found him again:
</p>

<p>
"Private John Hazel, No. 000, X. Platoon, F. Company, 4th
Battalion, 448th City of London (Fenchurch Street) Fusiliers!
.... Well, I sent the postcard to tell you about your friend....
Wallis&mdash;you see I remember his name&mdash;shot in the
shoulder with shrapnel.  He wasn't very badly hurt.
What!&mdash;you never got my message?"
</p>

<p>
John grinned, showing his mouthful of big, white teeth.
</p>

<p>
"No such gay luck!  Fritz handed me a Blighty one that
same afternoon, and I went down to the dressing-station
dug-outs by the Meat-Tray Express&mdash;the Wheeled Stretcher Line,
I mean!&mdash;and then back to the Base by the Gingerbread Chuff.
Sucking your toffee....  My word! that was some toffee.
I kept the wrapper a long time&mdash;till the nurses said it was
germy, and pitched it in the fire."
</p>

<p>
Her heart warmed to the familiar soldier-slang.  She gave
back his smile frankly.
</p>

<p>
"I think," she said, "I knew you from the first.  But how
wonderful that you should be <i>the</i> Hazel.  The man my
father"&mdash;She was graver and older now, with that shadow
of grief upon her face "&mdash;the man of whose coming my dear
father spoke, so often, and with such interest.  And now you
will never meet on earth.  Why, I wonder why?"
</p>

<p>
"Give it up.  Altogether, this is a jolly queer stunt.  So
queer that I've left off being astonished.  Wasn't it one of
those old Shakespearian Johnnies who said: '<i>There are more
things in Heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your
philosophy.</i>'  Not that I'm by way of cooling my heels outside Pit
doors to see the Bard played&mdash;give me a tuney Musical
Comedy or a rattling Revue!  But all the same, old W.S. has
got a knack of putting his finger on the spot,&mdash;now hasn't
he, Miss Forbis? ... But you ... I heard of your being
invalided Home.  A strain, they called it.  Did you get it that
day near Ypres?"
</p>

<p>
Katharine smiled.  He remembered the smile, breaking over
the face like sunshine....
</p>

<p>
"Oh no! but in the September following, when the German
airmen bombed our Hospital.  You see, they'd set on fire,
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And you carried a man out.  Hulking brute!  Ought to
have died before he let a woman lift him.  And&mdash;where were
the orderlies, I should like to know?"
</p>

<p>
The blustering tone angered Katharine.  "What business is
it of yours?" was written on her stiffened face.
</p>

<p>
"The man had no choice because he was unconscious, and
the orderlies' hands were full.  There were precious few of
them anyhow....  Army Nurses and V.A.D. girls evacuated
the wards before you could turn round.  Lifting is
nothing really&mdash;once you get the knack of it.  And&mdash;in those
days I was as strong as a man.  A really hefty man, I
mean!"  She stretched out a long arm with slow, powerful grace,
looking down its fair rounded length with critical approbation,
and then rose up, impressing John not only by her splendid
height, but by her air of authority, and supple grace of
movement.  She said, moving to an ancient rosewood
writing-bureau, unlocking one drawer of many in its upper part, and
taking a letter out:
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, if in view of the business in hand I remind
you that we're side-tracking.  This letter my father received
on December 21st.  He gave it me to read&mdash;it is signed with
the name upon your card&mdash;'John Benn Hazel.'  Do I understand
that it was written by you?"
</p>

<p>
He explained, keeping his big, black eyes upon her:
</p>

<p>
"From Colthill War Hospital, Middlesex.  I was there
when Old Mendel&mdash;when a confidential clerk in a relative's
counting-house brought me&mdash;just as he'd received 'em from
the East&mdash;a copy of my late grandfather's Will, and the
documents and other things concerned in this business....  There
has been delay....  I ought to have explained that a little
keepsake here&mdash;a love-token from Brother Boche&mdash;" he tapped
his big chest, somewhere above the left clavicular region&mdash;"kept
me from getting on to the job before....  I'm really
frightfully sorry!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  How could I forget your wound!"  Her eyes
softened as they took in the two gold stripes that graced his
cuff, the bagginess of his khaki on the giant frame, and the
brand-new ribbon of the D.C.M.  "You have been only
recently discharged from Hospital and are hardly quite strong
yet.  Are you?"
</p>

<p>
"First-class.  It only touches me up in the puff now and
then, like hell&mdash;I beg your pardon!"
</p>

<p>
John flushed darkly under his tough mahogany hide, and
amended:
</p>

<p>
"I meant to say that I lose my breath and can't get it back
again.  But this is side-tracking."  It was Katharine's turn to
flush.  "About&mdash;about that letter....  You see, I regularly
got the wind up when I sat down to write to your father....
And so&mdash;I naturally fell back upon the translated draft of the
letter of instructions written by my grandfather before his
death and sent me with his Will."
</p>

<p>
Her doubtful face grew clear.
</p>

<p>
"At last I begin to understand....  The original letter
and the Will were written in Hebrew?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, naturally, since Hebrew was the old man's native
tongue, when he wasn't talking French or Modern Greek, or
Arabic or Syriac...."
</p>

<p>
There was a spark of humour in the visitor's cavernous
black eyes, and Miss Forbis' wide, beautiful mouth began to
curl a little at the corners.
</p>

<p>
"This clears the air.  Will you think me&mdash;I hope you will
not think me offensively personal, Mr. Hazel, if I say that I
found between your language and the phraseology of your
letter, shall I say&mdash;a discrepancy that rather mystified me."
</p>

<p>
"Sure that!"
</p>

<p>
He pounded his knee as he used the Colonial word that the
War has grafted upon our English speech for ever&mdash;and broke
into his big coarse laugh, stopping short to glance at her
mourning dress, and redden to his beetling eyebrows, and the
cap of coarsely curling hair that capped his high-domed head,
as naïvely as a schoolboy.
</p>

<p>
But Katharine had forgotten to be critical.  In glancing
over the letter in the big black handwriting of this big-nosed,
black-avised young man, its sentences had once more cast their
curious glamour over her.  Her lips moved soundlessly as she
whispered to herself:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>To the present lord of the Towers of Kir Saba in North
Britain, and in Palestine, be it known by the word of Eli Ben
Hazaël, present Head of the House of Hazaël of Alexandria in
Egypt, and Jaffa in Palestine.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>The sum of moneys lent by Issachar Ben Hazaël, Merchant,
in the Year 1146 of the Christian Era to Sir Hew Forbys,
Knight, upon the fields, streams, vineyards and groves with the
Tower of Kir Saba in Palestine hath been recovered with the
interest thereupon due.  The Tower of Kir Saba with the
groves, vineyards, streams and fields appertaining, stand free
from debt.  Therefore are the sealed writings returned, with
the moneys that are over the sum of the indebtedness: by the
hand of a son of the House of Hazaël, who will receive
writings of acknowledgment for the same.</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>Let the present lord of the Tower of Kir Saba in Palestine
and in North Britain duly apprise the writer of this as to when
it will be convenient to him, to receive the representative of
Eli Ben Hazaël.</i>

<h3>
XVII
</h3>

<p>
Katharine looked up from the queer, absorbing letter, four
pages of big plain note with the printed address of the
Hospital, to meet the intent black stare of the representative of
the House of Hazaël....
</p>

<p>
She said, returning the letter to the envelope, and keeping
it in her hand as she went back to her chair opposite him:
</p>

<p>
"Your grandfather&mdash;was an old man?"
</p>

<p>
"He was nearly a hundred years of age, and mentally in
topping condition when the War happened and swept away
all his sons and grandsons too, except my brother and myself.
And that broke his heart.  Peace be upon him!" added John
without intending it.
</p>

<p>
"Peace be upon him!" echoed Katharine Forbis.  "I think
that is a beautiful thing to say.  He would have said it for
my dear father had he known!" she added.  "But they have
met by now, in that good place where all good men foregather.
Do you not think they have?"
</p>

<p>
"My grandfather was a devout Jew," said the big fleshy-lipped
mouth opposite her.
</p>

<p>
"And my father was a faithful Catholic," said Miss Forbis.
"And Catholics and Jews who have served God according to
the light He gave them, are equal in His sight.  Do you not
believe so?"
</p>

<p>
"I've never given much time to theological and&mdash;ar&mdash;ar&mdash;dogmatic
questions.  But at Lloyds it stands that all ships are
good ships if the insurance has been paid.  Now as to these
documents and things&mdash;"  John reached down a long arm and
hauled out from under his chair a business-like bag of shabby
cowskin.  "Here in this bag you see, I've got the whole
caboodle!"  (Really this was a very objectionable young
man.)  "But first, if you don't mind, the rings have got to be
verified.  That black agate you're wearing&mdash;and this of
mine...."
</p>

<p>
He wagged a huge third finger.  Katharine repressed a sense
of this big, florid, hook-nosed young City insurance-broker's
having taken a liberty, when she admitted, glancing at one of
the large, beautiful hands lying lightly clasped together on her
black lap:
</p>

<p>
"It is odd.  This ring&mdash;which is a family heirloom worn up
to the day of his death by my dear father&mdash;and that you have
on, are practically identical...."
</p>

<p>
"With this difference, that mine is the original intaglio, and
yours a facsimile of the design in relief.  The 'mate to the
gem' I rather think they'd call it."  He looked at the black
agate with the head of Hercules shouldering the club, and
crowned with the lion-mask, once the signet of Philoremus
Fabius, given by his patron to Hazaël the Jew.
</p>

<p>
"Would they? ... Oh, well, it's possible!" Katharine
admitted.  He went on:
</p>

<p>
"I was given to understand that this is no end of an
heirloom.  Been handed down in my grandfather's branch of the
family&mdash;the trunk, I suppose I ought to call it&mdash;since the year
308...."  He rubbed the antique greenish-gold setting on
his sleeve, and looked at it closely, then drew it from his big
third finger, and rose up from his chair.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Katharine Forbis as though he would never
have finished getting up.  With a strange sensation she also
realised that she was up against Antiquity and Tradition, in
the person of this Territorial Tommy grafted upon a Cornhill
insurance-broker; who spoke the colloquial English of the City,
mingled with the slang of the camp and the trenches,&mdash;as a
foreign language painstakingly acquired.  Great as was her
sense of race, it was belittled by Hazel's, with that history
behind him that was written by the Eternal Finger on the
living rock of Sinai....
</p>

<p>
And he was towering over her as she sat there&mdash;salient,
masterful&mdash;endued with an authority ancient as the hills.
Saying in his deep bass tones as he bent over her:
</p>

<p>
"It need not take a moment, Miss Forbis, but the form is
absolutely necessary.  It proves beyond doubt that you are
you, and that I am&mdash;whom I say I am! ... May I ask you
to hold out your left hand!"
</p>

<p>
She obeyed him, lightly resting the downward-turned palm
of the hand that wore the black onyx upon the upturned palm
of Hazel's.  Now he brought the faces of the rings together,
carefully adjusting them until the intaglio of his own ring
covered the relievo of its counterpart, and the gems wedded
into one chipped and shabby black onyx square....
</p>

<p>
"Good!"  The young London business man was once more
merged in the Jew of Syria.  "There could be no proof more
convincing than the marriage of these gems."  He lifted his
hand, and the rings were two again&mdash;and Katharine saw him
return to his chair and become once more a large young
London Territorial grafted on an insurance-broker, of Cornhill,
E.C.
</p>

<p>
"Now I must hand you over these...."  He was opening
the cowskin bag, dipping in his big hands and bringing out&mdash;were
these shrivelled things parchments?  Wrapped in squares
of faded yellowish silk, tanging the homely-sweet atmosphere
of the room with myrrh and benzoin and other Eastern odours,
spicy, pervasive, suggestive and queer.  "First of all&mdash;" he
handed the surprised Katharine the flat wallet of mouldy
parchment sewn with antique silkworm gut&mdash;"this contains
the original Title Deed of the Tower of Kir Saba, with the
fields, streams, wells, vineyards and groves appertaining,
granted to the Tribune Justus Martius of the Tenth Roman
Legion by the divine Emperor Vespasian, on the tenth day of
August in the second year of his reign...."
</p>

<p>
He paused to explain that the year was A.D. 70, when the
old Roman Johnnies under Titus took the temple at Jerusalem,
and then dealt with the remainder of the documents from the
deed of mortgage between Sir Hew Forbis, and Issachar Ben
Hazaël in the year 1146, down through the lengthy list of
accounts and vouchers, the latest cleanly typed in purple ink
on yellowish Levantine foolscap in the Jaffa offices of
Messrs. Abel Manasseh, Ephraim and Co.  Winding up:
</p>

<p>
"And I think you'll agree with me, Miss Forbis,&mdash;what with
Wars, earthquakes, locusts and dry seasons; the raids of the
Saracens and the Third and Fourth Crusades&mdash;not forgetting
the Fifth in 1197 when Pope Innocent III issued a Bull dooming
the people of the Ten Tribes to perpetual servitude,&mdash;that
during what we Jews have got some excuse for calling the
Dark Ages&mdash;there was nothing doing to any extent in the
wine- and olive-trade."
</p>

<p>
"You talk," Katharine murmured, "as though all this
happened yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Speaking in my sense," said John Hazel, "it happened in
December last...."
</p>

<p>
He went on,&mdash;seeming to feel his way,&mdash;garnishing his
sentences less and less with the argot of the City and the slang
of the trenches,&mdash;falling unconsciously more and more into the
dignified archaic English of the translated typescript:
</p>

<p>
"Christianity had a grudge to work off on us Hebrews.
When one of those jolly old mediæval jossers wanted to
cleanse his crime-stained soul, he had it rubbed into him at
G.H.Q. that the best Sapolio was the blood of a Jew.  If
kings or nobles wanted to raise an extra bit of pocket-money,
they'd only to squeeze a Jew between a brace of
paving-stones"&mdash;Katharine shuddered&mdash;"and drain away the gold.
Between imposts and confiscations, spoliations, expulsions and
massacres, not only in Syria but in West, North and Central
Europe,&mdash;we Hazaëls had hardly a fighting-chance to develop
our own, or another's property!  The lands of Kir Saba had
long lain desert round the ruins of the Tower,&mdash;when my
ancestors were driven into Spain, to join the Sephardim there....
In Spain we struck root and prospered, they tell me.  Near
the end of the fourteenth century Spain became too hot for
us.  With luck at low-water-mark and all the hounds of
Torquemada's Inquisition baying at our blistered heels, we flew
the coop into Mohammedan Turkey&mdash;and under the protection
of the Infidel we spat upon&mdash;Sultan Bayazet the Second&mdash;settled
on friendly soil and held up our heads again.  By
the middle of the Eighteenth Century things began to pick
up.  An astonishing discovery, originally touched upon by
Shakespeare in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> blazed like a meteor&mdash;I've
seen meteors blaze in France, but they were nothing
to the German star-shell!&mdash;across the mentality of intellectual
Christendom.  'The Jew pays better as a citizen than as a
pariah.  Pen him in the Ghetto and he cuts no ice&mdash;because
Gentile laws cripple his energies.  Let him out&mdash;he will be
more useful still!  His money is the golden manure of
successful speculation.  His Jewish brains are the pith and
marrow of every progressive plan.  In Law, Literature, Science,
Poetry, Music and Art the alien leads&mdash;only God knows the
reason!'"
</p>

<p>
The great clenched fist struck the mantelshelf heavily, making
its vases of ancient Persian pottery tremble on their ebony
pedestals:
</p>

<p>
"Fools!  When He showered these flaming gifts upon the
leaders of His Chosen People&mdash;did He not know that the Jew
of all men would use to most advantage what he had received.
So, from the kick-ball of the Dark Ages he has become the
hub of Civilisation.  The golden grease that oils the World's
axles as it spins between the Poles!"
</p>

<p>
He pulled up and looked at his listener like a man suddenly
awakened.  His big black eyes burned with a dull red
glow in their gaunt caves, and his bluish-shaded temples and
prominent forehead shone with little beads of wet.
</p>

<p>
"These things were nothing to me once," he explained with
a rather embarrassed shrug of his shoulders, "and now they
pretty well run the show.  Awfully sorry if I've talked too
much about ourselves, Miss Forbis.  But an explanation's
necessary, especially after"&mdash;his big white teeth showed as he
smiled&mdash;"our failure to hand in our accounts for nearly nine
hundred years.  Of course we have kept a base in Alexandria
since the beginning of the Fourth Century, and later
we established branches in Smyrna, Constantinople, Malta
and so on....  But it wasn't until 1833 that we got foothold
in Palestine and the vineyards of Kir Saba began to bear
again...."
</p>

<p>
"You make wine there?" Katharine asked with interest.
</p>

<p>
"We used to, on rather a big scale.  We have, or rather,
we had vaults on the property, on an area of about 5
<i>hectares</i>&mdash;(we use the French method of mensuration)&mdash;with cellars
and fermentation-rooms for use in vintage time, and an
ice-machine and dynamo for running the machinery....  The
Turks have smashed all that by now, and blown up the vaults
I daresay,&mdash;as they did our vaults at Rehon and Zicron-Reuben.
But I don't expect they let much of the wine run to
waste.  There are too many German officers with the Sultan's
Army Corps&mdash;and our Medocs and Sauternes&mdash;sweet wines&mdash;to
say nothing of our special Tokay&mdash;would be likely to appeal
to 'em!  Now may I trouble you with this cheque for a balance
due to you."
</p>

<p>
He handed Miss Forbis a pale green-and-blue slip,
representing a draft Payable to Order upon a London Branch of
the <i>Crédit Lyonnais</i> for £8,149.16.10, and requested her
acknowledgment for the same.
</p>

<p>
"Please to write 'Received by cheque&mdash;'" (Did he guess
what a wonderful windfall that eight thousand dropped into
her lap at this pinched juncture, seemed to Miss Forbis of
Kerr's Arbour, with an income reduced to microscopic
proportions by the War-slump in Home and Foreign Securities.)
"That's the best way to word it."  He took the acknowledgment
from her, adding: "That's posh!&mdash;I mean, correct!  Perhaps
you would kindly keep my card, in case you needed help of
any kind&mdash;that I could possibly give."
</p>

<p>
Something in the tone made Miss Forbis look round from
the Chippendale writing-chair in front of the old rosewood
bureau to whose drawer she had transferred the papers, and
the pale green and blue cheque on the <i>Crédit Lyonnais</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You are most kind, Mr. Hazel, but there can be no
legitimate reason why I should trouble you...."
</p>

<p>
"There's a reason, if it comes to that, and a thundering
good one!"
</p>

<p>
She laid down her pen and turned to him in smiling
inquiry:
</p>

<p>
"We of the House of Hazaël are bound to serve you and
yours....  It follows that we do so."
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean that you are bound by any provision or
clause in that old mortgage of the Tower?"
</p>

<p>
He returned in the calm authoritative tone that alternated
so oddly with his modern slanginess:
</p>

<p>
"I speak of a great debt of gratitude incurred by a remote
ancestor of mine to an early founder of your House&mdash;Philoremus
Florens Fabius, Prætor of the Egyptian taxes at
Alexandria&mdash;at the close of the Third Century, in my ancestor's
early youth."
</p>

<p>
"'Philoremus Florens Fabius, Prætor of Egyptian taxes at
Alexandria.' ..."
</p>

<p>
She leaned her cheek upon her hand, thoughtfully repeating
the name.  And all that was noble, patrician and austere in
her proud, frank, healthful, vigorous beauty irresistibly
appealed to the man who looked on her.  Not at all in the sexual
sense, though his was a sensuous nature.  But once and for
all he throned her in his heart as the noblest, dearest, most
worship-worthy of living women; and knew that she would
reign there as long as life should last....
</p>

<p>
She seemed to have forgotten John, so unrebuked he feasted,
revelling in the grace of the long limbs, the fair hands lying
folded together in her lap, the exquisite bend of the musing
head upon the long white throat.  No beauty she owned but
went home to him with a sudden poignant joy of recognition,
such as a man might experience, if, after years of hopeless
separation, he were to find himself face to face with a beloved
friend:&mdash;"As if a chap with a bayonet had jabbed me in the
ribs!" he thought,&mdash;puzzled by the bliss that hurt,&mdash;reverting
to Private Hazel....  And then he caught his breath, for her
eyes had come back to his again.  And they were kind as she
asked:
</p>

<p>
"This money&mdash;this eight thousand pounds odd, you have
just paid me.  Can your firm afford to part with so much,
when you have suffered such losses since the Turks joined
the War?"
</p>

<p>
"We've got a bit put by against a rainy day."  His face
was mask-like in imperturbability as he recalled that trifling
balance of three-hundred-and-eighty-thousand.  Noting the
smoothing of the slight, anxious line between Miss Forbis'
handsome eyebrows, John guessed that the family were not
over-flush.  Who knew but that the eight thousand hadn't
dropped into the lap of Katharine in the very nick of time.
Proving his acumen, for indeed those unexpected thousands
were a Godsend.  But she was saying with a rather bewildered
smile:
</p>

<p>
"I shall take a little time to get quite used to the idea of
having property in the Holy Land....  And how odd that there
should be one Kerr's Arbour here&mdash;and another over in
Palestine&mdash;and that my father should never have heard of the
existence of such a place!"
</p>

<p>
"The papers will make all that clear to you....  And&mdash;'Kerr's
Arbour' is merely a corruption of 'Kir Saba,' as Kir
Saba is a contraction of Kirjath Saba.  The Tower of Kir
Saba in Palestine has given this place its name....  'The
Walled Place of Saba' is the English translation from the
Hebrew."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens! ..." murmured Katharine.
</p>

<p>
The huge dark man got up from his chair and leaned an
elbow on the mantelshelf, and went on speaking in a deep
slow tone that seemed the very voice of Time....
</p>

<p>
"The Philistines built the stronghold in the Year of the
World 1160&mdash;when they came from the nor'west in their
bird-beaked galleys, with shields set round the carven bulwarks,
and scarlet lug-sails....  They set their ships on waggons
drawn by great teams of oxen, and pushed up from the southward
into Northern Syria and took the Coastal Plain....  Ashdod
was Aasgaard then, and the Sons of Odin held revel there&mdash;with
deer and hogs roasted whole, and barley-loaves baked
in the ashes, and wine and beer and mead.  Making sacrifices
and libations to the stone image of their bearded long-staffed
god, with the high hat and travelling mantle&mdash;just as
blue-painted Teutons with long yellow hair, worshipped the wooden
effigy in the clay, wattle and tree-trunk temples of Alemannia&mdash;and
under the tall hanging-stones of Britain's Holy Rings....
But it was razed to the ground&mdash;I speak of the stronghold
later known as Kir Saba&mdash;in the time of Solomon the King.
And when King Solomon,&mdash;peace be upon him!&mdash;gave the
City of Gaza to Balkis, Queen of Sheba,&mdash;woman-like she
coveted, and asked, and got for her asking, the new Tower
built by the King among the vineyards north of Joppa&mdash;that
were famous for the greatness and sweetness of their grapes."
</p>

<p>
He removed a great brown hand from the marble to rub
his forehead, and went on in the deep slow tone:
</p>

<p>
"Long after the glory of the King, like the beauty of the
Queen&mdash;had passed into a dusty legend,&mdash;the Philistines
possessed the land once more.  And Kir Saba was destroyed
again,&mdash;and again rebuilt&mdash;and burned, as I have said, by the
Kharezmian Tartars in the year of the Christian Era, 1244."
</p>

<p>
He coughed, stuck a thumb in his belt and continued in
quite a different tone:
</p>

<p>
"As for the building as it stands now&mdash;supposing the Turks
have left any of it,&mdash;it dates from somewhere in the Tenth
Century, rather more than a hundred and seventy years before
the time of Sir Hew."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0218"></a></p>

<h3>
XVIII
</h3>

<p>
"Ah, yes, Sir Hew! ..." Katharine responded.  "Naturally
as the builder of Kerr's Arbour, Sir Hew's name is more
familiar to us than that of many a later ancestor.  I will except
Sir Mark, at whose portrait you are looking now...."
</p>

<p>
Her glance followed her visitor's to a noble Vandyke canvas
set in the panelling above the mantelshelf.
</p>

<p>
"'Sir Mark Forbys,'" John read out from the rusty-gilt
lettering beneath, "'Captain-General In The Royal Forces,
1645.  Killed At The Battle of Naseby.'"
</p>

<p>
Below the lettering was the coat-of-arms whose faded
gilding shone on the courtyard-gates.  The jut of the hooded
hearth, below the narrow mantelshelf, showed the coat again,
sculptured in bold relief: and wrought in enamel on the guard
of Sir Mark's sword&mdash;embroidered on the crimson scarf that
crossed his breast, and on the corner of the velvet saddle-cloth
of the Arab charger held in the background by a handsome
waiting page; the three silver scallop-shells on a <i>fesse</i> between
two chevrons black and gold, were topped by the crest of the
wolf's head, scrolled with its legend, indecipherably minute,
or clear and plain to read:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "FORBYS FOES FA"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
John's eyes softened as they rested on the brilliant, clear-cut
face, of which Katharine's was a softer feminine replica.  For
all the laces, velvets and silks of his splendid figure in its
damascened steel-plate, with the rich brown curls hanging in
heavy masses on the rose-point of its Stuart collar, Sir Mark
bore the cachet of a dominating race.  A proven blade in a
velvet sheath, a fighter for all his frippery....
</p>

<p>
Bringing his glance back from the portrait to Sir Mark's
living descendant, John Hazel, with a queer thrill of proprietary
pride, promised himself that the foes of this Forbis should
not for want of a champion, remain standing upright!
</p>

<p>
Had she an enemy?  If so, let him look out for himself
if ever John Hazel had the chance to get at him.  And then,
with a sudden blinding flare of recollection&mdash;as though a
searchlight had found at last a thing that had been hovering
in the dark of semi-forgetfulness&mdash;beyond the range of active
consciousness&mdash;came the memory of the story heard in the
train&mdash;the incredible tale of Katharine's betrayal&mdash;the
dreadful news that soon would have to be broken, that might come
crashing down upon her any moment now....
</p>

<p>
Treacherous hound....  Damnable, lying, sneaking&mdash;No!
The face of the man seen upon the day before, rose up in
Hazel's memory.  Not a face easily forgotten.  Thin, brown,
handsome, refined,&mdash;with straight, clear-cut features, and-grey,
miserable, desperate eyes....
</p>

<p>
Again Katharine addressed John Hazel, and he started.
His heavy Army boot ground on the kerb of the fireplace
as he turned to answer her.  In the same instant, beyond and
behind her as she sat before him in her chair,&mdash;framed in
the open glass-doors of the more distant of the terrace-windows,&mdash;he
saw the tall khaki figure and the haunted face of
Yaill.
</p>

<p>
Their looks met.  Something in the nature of an appeal and
a reply passed between the gaunt black eyes and the miserable
grey ones.  Then the tall khaki figure moved on.  Not so
swiftly but that the sound of his booted footsteps on the
terrace tiles reached the keen ear of Katharine.  Her head turned
the fraction of an inch towards the window ... a wonderful
light broke over her, transfiguring, irradiating....  Marvel
of marvels....  John Hazel found himself looking for the
first time in the face of Beautiful Love.
</p>

<p>
Love....  Not at all the kind of love familiar to John
Hazel.  Not the cocktail-kindled emotion of the restaurant or
supper-club.  Not the love of a Birdie Bright or any of her
venal sisters,&mdash;but the love of a clean-souled, pure-hearted
Katharine for her chosen lover, her one "Man of all men."
</p>

<p>
Submerged for a moment in a great wave of emotion, John
Hazel caught his breath, reddened and gulped.  Such facial
characteristics as a prominent forehead, tanned and
tough-skinned as the knee of a Highlander, and capped with wiry
closely-curling hair of inky blackness,&mdash;the heavy smudge of
eyebrows thatching those glowing eye-caverns&mdash;the great
salient hooked nose, coarse fleshily-lipped mouth and portentously
lengthy chin with a cleft in it&mdash;could not be said to
constitute a sympathetic visage.  And yet, Katharine found
herself seized with a sudden, irresistible conviction that this
strange young man was sorry for her....
</p>

<p>
Just as she had caught a passing glimpse of Edward, her
man of men, her precious dear one!&mdash;pacing the terrace up and
down in the nipping sunshine, threading the frosty garden-walks
with no better companion than his pipe to cheer him,
until his Kathy should bestow her company on him again....
</p>

<p>
Sorry.  Why should the grandson of Eli Hazaël be so
sorry for Katharine Forbis?  For the man had pitied her&mdash;it
had been written in his face.  Ah, now Katharine
understood, and understanding, blushed a little.  Mark had been
killed....  Julian was Missing, and&mdash;when to-morrow's
solemn rites should be concluded&mdash;and that dear sleeper be
carried from the chapel to rest in the Forbis' vault under the
shadow of the Tower&mdash;Katharine would be alone....
</p>

<p>
Utterly alone, had it not been for Edward.  Oh, thanks to
God! for that gift of his faithful love.  And what was the
deep bass voice of this extraordinary John Hazel saying?
She roused herself to attention with a little, secret sigh:
</p>

<p>
Edward was waiting for her in the garden after long years
of separation, but Father would have wished her to be
particularly gracious to this queer young man from Cornhill.
Father had looked forward to his coming with extraordinary
interest....  He would have towed him off to his den; and
they would have been boxed up hours together, questioning
and answering....  And you would have heard the Jew's big
voice booming down the gallery in spite of the thickness of the
old oak door....
</p>

<p>
She broke a silence that grew awkward, saying in her
mellow tones:
</p>

<p>
"About the borrowing of the money for the building of the
Tower, here on our Scottish Border, there must be some
story....  He&mdash;my dearest&mdash;" her thought went tenderly to
the sleeper lying not far off in the sacred silence of the
chapel&mdash;"he always said there must be one, and that we should
light on it some day.  We have our legend about the Roman
tribune Marcus Fabius (who must have been a son of Philoremus
Florens Fabius).  He was bred by a community of Coptic
monks in Egypt, and came over to Britain in the service of
the Emperor Constantine.  But beyond his signature appended
to a queer lead-sealed parchment covered with crabbed brown
Gothic handwriting&mdash;a kind of Twelfth century builder's
estimate&mdash;kept with other family papers in our strong-room&mdash;where
the wonderful crumbly Title Deed of Kir Saba and all
the rest shall join it presently!&mdash;of Sir Hew, hardly anything
is known."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what I've crammed of Hew."  The speaker
went on, feeling for his sentences, sometimes using the
excellent if archaic English of the translated letter, other times
reverting to modern slang: "He was a Crusader who had
served Baldwin I, King of Jerusalem"&mdash;(the thick mouth under
the cropped black moustache sneered a little)&mdash;"first as page
and cupbearer, afterwards as body-squire, and later on as a
Knight, in Baldwin's last campaign of 1118.  He got what
one might call a Blighty wound&mdash;an arrow through the fleshy
part of the thigh&mdash;in 1145&mdash;driving the Egyptians under
Nureddin, their Sultan, out of the castles and coast-towns of
Palestine; and the fever of the country&mdash;malaria, we'd call
it!&mdash;seems to have given him beans.  But being recovered of
his wound under the care of Issachar Ben Hazaël, who
tended him as his own son in his house near Joppa, he rebuilt
and adorned the Tower of Kir Saba, which had been
held as a fortress by the invading Paynims&mdash;that means the
Egyptians under the Abbasside&mdash;and then 'wearying of
Palestine'&mdash;this was in 1146&mdash;'bethought him of quitting the Holy
Land and returning to Britain straightway.' ..."
</p>

<p>
Katharine was listening, fair cheek on white hand, as some
twelfth-century lady of the Forbis race might have listened
to the tale of Hew....
</p>

<p>
"But want of boodle intervened, according to Hew's
chronicler.  Restoring castles even in those days, sometimes
spelt bankruptcy, and '<i>being impoverished</i>'&mdash;I'm quoting from
a contemporaneous document&mdash;'<i>firstly by the great cost of
hewn stone and timber; and secondly by his excessive love of
good wine, feasting and prodigality; the shows of jugglers, the
songs of minstrels&mdash;and the company of the daughters of
Delilah, this Knight cast about to raise money upon loan.</i>'"
</p>

<p>
The narrator broke off to comment:
</p>

<p>
"A sporty boy, Hew, evidently,&mdash;and not the first Brass
Hat who's enlivened his H.Q. on a War Front&mdash;with imported
talent and beauty&mdash;of the Musical Comedy kind.  So
being short of cash to settle his accounts, and charter ships
to carry him home, and incidentally rebuild the Tower of Kir
Saba in North Britain 'so as to make the dwelling seemly for
a lord of his estate,' Sir Hew engineered a loan from the Jew,
Issachar Ben Hazaël of Joppa&mdash;the Joppa of those days is
Jaffa to-day,&mdash;and the facts I'm giving are taken from a letter,
written in the Twelfth Century <i>lingua Franca</i>, and the usual
Gothic hand.  I've a translation as well as the original, which
of course is our property....  Means nothing to me but brown
scratches on mouldy sheepskin, though to my pal Harding,
ex-Curator of the Mediæval Manuscript Dep. at the British
Museum&mdash;it would have been toffee and peppermint-rock.
First-class man, my pal Harding&mdash;killed last March at
Richebourg St. V."  He answered Katharine's look of
interrogation.  "A German prisoner shot him from the rear, in our
trenches....  And I went balmy and laid out the Hun! ..."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that you&mdash;killed the prisoner who did it?"  Miss
Forbis' cairngorm eyes were cold and judicial in their
regard.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."  John nodded, and Katharine told herself that
the man was a brute as well as a bounder.  "But I seem to
have been getting away from Sir Hew...."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you have!"  Sarcasm was lost upon this pachydermatous
person, who murdered prisoners in calm defiance
of the Geneva Convention.  "Why did he want to build another
Kir Saba here on the Border?"
</p>

<p>
"Because&mdash;though he'd got a Tower here already, he didn't
consider it seemly for a lord of his swagger, being only 'of
great stones unmortared and unbevelled, standing inside a
paled enclosure of wattle and posts and earth.'"
</p>

<p>
"Then that is why the old chronicles call it a
pale-tower?"  Katharine's interest was eager and vivid now....
</p>

<p>
"A pale-tower.  I expect so.  And the bags of French gold
were wanted to pay the architect's fee and the wages of the
stone-quarriers; and 'the lime and sand wherewith to mortar
the stone, and the cost of the clippings of a troop of the
Scots King's horse, the better to bind the same.'  So the
mortgage of Kir Saba was drawn up, signed and sealed&mdash;you've
got it there with the rest&mdash;and you ought to have a duplicate
somewhere!  And the bags of French gold were packed in
boxes and sent down to Sir Hew's ship.  He had three of 'em,
high-sterned three-banked galleys with scarlet-lug-sails, to take
him and his servants, and his Arab horses, and the rest of his
baggage home to Britain&mdash;and the one he chose for his own
use was called <i>The Scottish Crown</i>...."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;do go on!"  Katharine began to see Sir Hew, healed
of his arrow-wound by the Jew's skill, with the brown of
Syrian suns on his fair skin, and their bleach on his yellow
hair&mdash;going home to rebuild his Tower and rear his long-legged,
broad-shouldered race of Forbis.  "This part of the
story is wonderfully interesting.  If only Father had been
alive to hear it to-day!"
</p>

<p>
"There's not so much to tell.  Hew got ready to sail.  Old
Issachar Ben Hazaël loaded him with gifts; myrrh and spices,
incense and dried raisins,&mdash;Egyptian hangings and silk
embroideries, mother-of-pearl and turquoises; ivory and rare
woods&mdash;fresh fruit for the voyage and so on....  And Hew
took all that he could get&mdash;not that I'm inclined to blame him!
But at the last minute he wanted a thing with which my
ancestor wasn't inclined to part....  Issachar Hazaël had a
daughter....  It seems&mdash;"  The tone changed....  The
sentences came dropping from the heavy mouth like strings of
cold, weighty, slippery, polished beads of jade&mdash;or so it seemed
to Katharine: "It seems that my ancestress and Sir Hew had
met at our house&mdash;it is our house still!&mdash;if the Turks have
left it standing amongst the orange and olive-groves to the
nor'east of Jaffa.  And&mdash;the girl was beautiful, and
Hew&mdash;was a Crusader...."
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;wished to marry her?"  The tone was enigmatical.
</p>

<p>
"He broached the subject of marrying her&mdash;an hour before
he sailed."
</p>

<p>
"With what success?"
</p>

<p>
"With the&mdash;result that might have been expected."
</p>

<p>
Their looks crossed like swords.  And resentment burned
in Katharine.  She stiffened and drew more upright in her
chair.
</p>

<p>
"The Jew&mdash;refused to entertain my ancestor's proposal?"
</p>

<p>
"Just that.  He said to him"&mdash;the voice of the speaker
changed and deepened:
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Thou hast the gold and the goods.  Depart with that
which is thine to the country of thine adoption.  When the
money is recovered in the fulness of time, the title-deeds
concerning Kir Saba will be given back again....  For</i>'"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The big voice echoed among the rafters of the heavily-beamed
room, making a brass Chinese gong hung upon a stand
at the further end, vibrate with a faint tenor humming....
</p>

<p>
"'<i>For by a great oath sworn by a forefather of our race in
ancient times, we of the Hazaël are bound to succour the
children of thy House unto the final generation.  That oath we
have kept, and will keep, Sir Knight.  But we do not defile the
pure stream of Jewish lineage with the blood of Gentile
veins.  I have spoken!</i>' ..."
</p>

<p>
Fierce scarlet leaped to the roots of Katharine's hair.  As
though the speaker had struck or insulted her, she rose from
her seat with one swift supple movement,&mdash;and so stood facing
him, quivering with wrath.  He too had risen&mdash;and thus the
woman and the man opposed each other in a silence that both
knew hostile; pregnant with hatred, racial, religious&mdash;sprung
green and poisonous from the dust of nearly two thousand
years....
</p>

<p>
"He dared to speak so to a Scottish gentleman!  A Jew!" ...
</p>

<p>
The great black eyes beneath Hazel's heavy eyebrows burned
like live coals.  His deep voice echoed:
</p>

<p>
"A Jew, Miss Forbis.  A representative of the People who
received the Law from Sinai.  Who possessed, besides the
Torah, Literature, Poetry, Arts and Sciences&mdash;even when a
rabble of Aryan nations, swept North by the besom of some
Assyrian conqueror&mdash;rolled into the Caucasus through the
Pass of Dariel.  Verily, verily!&mdash;and peopled Russia and
Germany,&mdash;crossing lakes and seas and rivers on log-rafts and in
boats of osiers and skins.  And paddling across the North
Sea&mdash;and building forts of tree-trunks at the mouth of an
estuary&mdash;laid the foundations of the British Nation of which
you boast to-day!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0219"></a></p>

<h3>
XIX
</h3>

<p>
So they stood face to face, the Occident and the Orient,
until the tact of the woman, the subtlety of the man&mdash;suggested
the compromise of an exchanged smile.
</p>

<p>
"After all it is very Ancient History....  I think," said
Katharine with a gleam of mirth in her eyes of gold and
bramble-dew, "that your ancestor was discourteous, and
mine&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A little bit premature.  Or tardy from another point of
view,&mdash;in asking for what he'd got already.  For Sir Hew and
my ancestress had been married a week or so back&mdash;by a
Catholic friar who had baptised Judith&mdash;after having received
her abjuration of her Jewish faith.  Between them they broke
the news to Issachar Hazaël, 'who at first made naught of the
Lady Judith's entreaties, but after many tears, embraces and
cajoleries, suffered himself to be persuaded to sit with them
at meat.'"
</p>

<p>
"Did he? ... I should have suspected&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Rats&mdash;if I'd been in the sandals of the Lady Judith&mdash;and
I'd have made an inner bull if I had!  '<i>He would taste of no
dish</i>'&mdash;according to my Twelfth Century scribe&mdash;but he '<i>filled
an ancient silver cup with the best wine of Kir Saba, and
touched it with his lips once: seeming to drink while dropping
into the goblet under cover of his beard, which was white as
the snow of Herman, and fully an ell long&mdash;a ring of black
onyx incarven very curiously, having a head of the Greek
Hercules-with his club and lion-mask.</i>'"
</p>

<p>
"The ring you wear.  The fellow to my ring!  And it was
poisoned?"
</p>

<p>
"This ring I wear&mdash;the signet from his hand.  There's a
little compartment with a spring-lid, back of the setting, so I
suppose it held poison&mdash;as you say, when he '<i>did hand the
goblet to the Lady Judith, bidding her pledge him.  But Sir
Hew, stretching forth his hand in sport, laid hold of the
goblet, whereupon said Hazaël: "Drink first, my Lady Forbis!"
and she answered: "That will I right gladly, O my father! but
thou and mine husband must kiss me first!"  So she took the
kisses and gave them back, and quaffed off the cup right
merrily&mdash;and died as though she had been struck by lightning, not
falling down, but sitting stiff and smiling in her chair....</i>'"
</p>

<p>
There was a silence in the room.  Then Katharine murmured,
still vibrating:
</p>

<p>
"Women knew how to love in those days!" ...
</p>

<p>
"And men knew how to hate!" ...
</p>

<p>
"And is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"All, except that Sir Hew leaped up, and cried, when the
corpse fell down out of the chair upon the daïs strewn with
lion-skins: '<i>We were wed by a priest!  I dealt honourably by
her!</i>'  And Issachar said,&mdash;and I think he comes out of it
pretty well on the whole: '<i>What is honour in thine esteem is
dishonour in mine!  For the girl, she was begotten of these
my loins....  Take what is thine, Sir Knight, and depart an'
thou will to thine own adopted country.  I deal as I choose
with that which is mine own!</i>'  Straight off the ice, I call that.
Fine old fellow!"
</p>

<p>
Katharine said, a little breathlessly, for the thrill of a great
tragic happening seemed to be in the air:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was great, and terrible and merciless...."
</p>

<p>
"Hardly to Judith.  When he'd once got her over in Britain,
Hew would have gone back to the Beauty Chorus.  For I'm
not over struck on Hew," said John Hazel with a queer quirk
of his fleshy underlip.  "He appears to have anticipated the
Profiteer's motto of the present date.  Perhaps you've heard
it?  '<i>Self first, me next, and I'll take whatever's left over!</i>'
Now I've gone and made you wild with me all over
again!"
</p>

<p>
His huge size, and his genuine ruefulness, contrasted so
queerly that Katharine, still tingling to the finger-tips at the
insult to Sir Hew, was forced to smile.
</p>

<p>
"It is a mercy we are not likely to meet often, Mr. Hazel.
We should quarrel inevitably.  And yet&mdash;"  There was sweetness
in the smile of her eyes of cairngorm brown as she
stretched out her long arm and offered her hand to him, saying:
"And yet, in a tight place, I would trust you before most
men!"
</p>

<p>
"Give me the chance, Miss Forbis!"  His black eyes flashed
in their deep caves as her white hand was engulfed in his
huge brown one.
</p>

<p>
"If there is need," she said, "I will not fail to!"
</p>

<p>
"It's a bargain then!" said John Hazel, and released the
hand.  "Now I must be going.  I have trespassed on your
time most frightfully."  He turned and reached down to the
floor and picked up the cowskin bag....
</p>

<p>
"One moment, Mr. Hazel!"  For he was striding towards
the door, and urgently as she desired to be quit of her strange
untimely visitor, the sacred bond of old fidelity, exerted its
strong invisible influence between these two, so utterly
dissimilar&mdash;making her add, even as she laid her hand on
Whishaw's summoning bell: "You would&mdash;would you not wish
to attend my father's funeral?"
</p>

<p>
"I meant to, whether you were willing or not! ..."
</p>

<p>
The tone robbed the assertive words of all offence.  She
answered:
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  He will be laid to rest in the vault in our
little private burying-ground the day after to-morrow.
Monday morning, immediately after the Requiem Mass at ten.  If
it will be difficult or bad for you,"&mdash;her glance was kind for
the hollow cheeks and the bagginess of the khaki on the great
wasted body&mdash;"to drive over from Cauldstanes in this sharp
weather at so early an hour&mdash;I know my father would have
been glad to&mdash;to have you stay...."  She added as Whishaw
opened the door: "Perhaps you would dine with us to-morrow
and sleep the night here?"
</p>

<p>
"It would put you out."  His vast shoulders filled the open
doorway, the lintel of which just cleared his towering head.
He added as Whishaw faintly clacked behind him: "It's
awfully good of you to suggest finding me a bivvy, but the
motor-bike that brought me over here to-day&mdash;it belongs to
the son of the landlady at the <i>Cross Keys</i>&mdash;will hold together
long enough&mdash;at least I hope so!&mdash;to carry me over the distance
again.  But there's one thing I'll ask you.  Not, as a
favour, mind you!&mdash;but as a right, to let me&mdash;<i>see him</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Whishaw again forgot himself so far as to clack, this time
distinctly.  Miss Forbis' momentary hesitation was dissipated
by the sound.  She bent her head in grave assent, took her
black lace veil and blue-check apron from the writing-table,
saying to John Hazel:
</p>

<p>
"Wait here one instant!" and quitted the room, closely
followed by her ancient serving-man.
</p>

<p>
As the door shut behind them John Hazel's expression
altered.  His beetling eyebrows drew into a savage line over
his great hooked nose, and his swarthy colour faded to ashen
brown.  His coarse mouth hardened grimly as he crossed with
long, noiseless strides to the open terrace-window, and stood
there for a moment, quietly looking out.  At the first glimpse
the sunshiny terrace showed deserted of the pacing khaki
figure....  Then the crack of a kindled match broke the
silence.  Yaill stepped from behind the buttress that had
sheltered him as he had paused to light another pipe.  The
fragrance of the good weed came to Hazel's nostrils, as their
eyes met for the second time that day....
</p>

<p>
"Did you wish to speak to me, by any chance?"
</p>

<p>
The great menacing figure blocking the window-frame
slewed its head in the customary quarter-turn, and raised ar
hand in the usual salute.
</p>

<p>
"As man to man&mdash;not as private to field-officer&mdash;I have
something urgent to say to you, Colonel Yaill."
</p>

<p>
A pale light flickered in the sorrowful grey eyes he looked
at.  Was it irresolution, anger, apprehension?  The actual
truth he utterly failed to guess.  Relief....  The die cast, the
doubt resolved, the tangle straightened....  The path clear
for the lonely feet till death....
</p>

<p>
"Have you?  Well, carry on!  We have no hearers.  Will
you come outside, or shall I come in? ..."
</p>

<p>
John stepped back.  Yaill entered.  The men confronted
each other.  There was one instant's pause before Hazel said:
</p>

<p>
"This is Saturday forenoon&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Twelve pip emma precisely."  Yaill glanced at the cheap
new watch upon his wrist.  A flush burned his thin brown
cheeks as he remembered that the bauble had been Lucy's
wedding-gift.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve Saturday....  The Funeral is to be on Monday
at ten o'clock...."
</p>

<p>
"You are incorrect.  Monday at ten-thirty...."
</p>

<p>
"I aim at being plain and short with you, sir.  If by three
o'clock on Monday afternoon you have not told Miss Forbis
of your marriage, I am going to save you the trouble, Colonel
Yaill."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?" ... Yaill's face was deathly under its sun-tan.
"Perhaps you'll tell me who the Hell you are?" ...
</p>

<p>
John answered with a grim inexpressive visage:
</p>

<p>
"You can see for yourself.  A London Territorial....
Ranker as long as this blasted old War goes on....  And a
kind of&mdash;family friend of this house of Forbis....  If you're
taking any further explanation&mdash;I'm bound to tell you you
won't get it here...."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Your name? ..."  It was the crisp, curt tone
that marks the caste of the officer, making the other stiffen
against his will:
</p>

<p>
"Private John Benn Hazel, No. 000.  X Platoon&mdash;Company
F.  4th Battalion, 448th City of London Fusiliers, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I shall remember.  Good-day to you, Private Hazel.  And
carry on!"
</p>

<p>
"You may be sure I will!"
</p>

<p>
The door-handle turned as the short, stern colloquy ended.
Both men looked round and saw Katharine standing near the
door.  Her black lace veil draped her head with mystery.  In
her hand was a little bunch of purple violets, whose perfume
made rich sweetness in the air....  She made a sign to Hazel
that he should follow her, gave one swift glance of tenderness
to Edward, and left the room, followed by his enemy....
</p>

<p>
"I was going to give him these.  Perhaps you would like
to?" she said, putting the flowers in John's great hand.  He
mumbled something she did not catch, but she understood
that he would like to, as she led the way down the vaulted
corridor&mdash;pausing before opening the chapel door to stroke the
decrepit pointer-bitch Dawtie, who lay with her muzzle
between her forepaws, keeping guard over the sleeper who would
wake in Time no more....
</p>

<p>
Then she passed into the sacred place; bent in reverence
before the Presence in the Tabernacle, and led the way up the
little aisle closely followed by John.  He heard her say in a
low, clear voice, as he stood near the feet of the old man who
lay in the long oak coffin:
</p>

<p>
"Father dear, here is a friend of ours whom you have
wished to see! ..."
</p>

<p>
Just as though the old man lying there had not been dead
at all....  He&mdash;Sir Philip&mdash;must have been a tall man, rather
narrow than broad-chested; and in youth his fine aquiline-featured
face, now set in the sternness of death, might have
belonged to his ancestor Marcus Fabius&mdash;that Tribune of
Constantine,&mdash;who superintended the building of fortified camps
on the Scottish Border&mdash;and planted millions of barbed iron
prongs on the brae-sides and in the moss-hags for the
bedevilment of naked Celtic feet.
</p>

<p>
So John laid the bunch of violets below the stiff grey hands
that were clasped over a Crucifix and had a Rosary threaded
between their rigid fingers,&mdash;and rode back on his borrowed
motor-bike to the <i>Cross Keys</i> at Cauldstanes&mdash;an ancient stone
box full of prehistoric smells (stale beer and boiled cabbage
predominating)&mdash;and slept in a bedroom with an uphill floor,
crowded with glass-fronted cases of stuffed salmon and trout,
owls, heron, and moth-eaten brocks and foxes.

XX
</h3>

<p>
On Monday John attended the Funeral, driving out to Kerr's
Arbour in the dog-cart, in company of Mr. Kellar, the
Cauldstanes solicitor and notary, who had heard, possibly through
Mrs. Govan, that the big black sojer-man from London was
"somehow conneckit wi' the family at Kerr's."
</p>

<p>
Khaki predominated, for the General commanding at the
P&mdash;&mdash; Depot attended with his <i>aide-de-camp</i>, and the officers
of the Fourth and Fifth Squadrons of the Tweedburgh Light
Horse officiated as pall-bearers at the burial of their Chief....
In the company of the handful of troopers detailed to act
as escort, John Hazel remained near the door of the chapel
throughout the Requiem Mass.  Declining with obstinate
shakes of the head Whishaw's hoarse-whispered invitations
that he should "tak' a move up and sit wi' the family" in
the parallel rows of benches close-packed by County friends
and tenants, and a relative here and there....  Red Cross
uniforms were worn by many among the women,&mdash;nor was wanting
the khaki of the L.L.W.S.L.  If the green eyes of Trixie
Lady Wastwood picked out among the troopers on the benches
near the west door, her fellow-traveller of two days
previously&mdash;John remained ignorant of the fact.
</p>

<p>
Bolt upright against the plastered wall left of the chapel
door, his great height lifting him above the heads of the
congregation, his hawk-vision showed him through an
unfamiliar, glittering haziness&mdash;the long coffin covered with the
Union Jack, on its black-draped trestles, with its single wreath
of violets, gathered and placed there that morning by the
daughter's loving hand....
</p>

<p>
An old-type long brass-scabbarded R.H.A. sword with the
heavy-fringed sash of faded crimson, rested on the Red,
White and Blue, with the soldier's medals and decorations....
The Burmese War Medal of 1826, the four-barred
Crimean medal with its faded blue yellow-edged ribbon, the
medal of the Indian Mutiny, ribbon white and scarlet; the
Turkish Order of the Medjidie with its star and crimson circle,
the Maltese Cross of the C.B., the K.C.V.O., the Belgian Order
of Leopold; and the eight-pointed, red-enamelled gold Cross
of the Pontifical Order of St. Gregory....
</p>

<p>
Two figures kneeling on <i>prie-dieux</i> on the right of the coffin
nearest the gate in the Communion-rail, drew and held the
black hawk-eyes from the beginning of the Rite to its close.
A tall brown-haired man in khaki, and a woman in deepest
mourning, tall also, and bending like a palm in tempest under
her shrouding black crape veil.  When the fragrant incense
rose at the chant of the Responsory:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "<i>Libera me Domine, de morte æterna.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
When the Kyrie Eleison wailed out, and the Paternoster
filled the silence; when the priest circled the bier, asperging
the feet, the middle and the head of the corpse with the
consecrated Water; when the prayer of Hope and Faith ended
with the intoned "Amen" and Yaill rose to his feet and
stepped to the head of the coffin&mdash;John Hazel got up too from
the back-bench, where he was sitting: glowering, reluctant but
driven on by a Force he could not but obey....
</p>

<p>
That unseen hand that had thrust down his head when
he entered the presence of Katharine had him again in its
resistless grip....  He went up the little aisle between the
packed benches, moving with long, noiseless strides, and took
his place opposite Yaill.  Had he been asked why he did this,
he would have mumbled that it had seemed only the decent
thing to lend a hand, and yet the impulse, rendered into words,
would have been capable of a nobler interpretation:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Thou hast here no son to bear thee to thy tomb.  Therefore,
let me render thee this service, whom, never having heard thy
voice or touched thy living hand,&mdash;I, by the oath of my
forefather, nevertheless am bound to serve.  And after thee those
that are thine, as long as life remains to me!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The muttered word of command was drowned by the harmonium.
The troopers detailed as bearers clanked up the aisle,
Yaill's hand steadying the coffin as they lifted it&mdash;John Hazel
taking upon his shoulders his full share of its weight.  Seeing
the words, "Because thou hast no son," written in letters of
golden fire upon the frescoed stone walls, in violet and orange
and fiery crimson across the face of the rose-window in the
ogive over the West door, as the escort formed in file at the
head of the procession and passed out by a side-exit, heralding
the bearer of the Crucifix with its child-borne lights, the
chanting choir, the tall young officer with the black-craped
regimental Standard, and&mdash;carried by five tall Light Horsemen
and one taller infantryman&mdash;its pall borne by officers of the
Fourth and Fifth Squadrons&mdash;the coffin of their dead
Chief....
</p>

<p>
So they bore him to the little private burial-place at the
foot of the wood-shagged hill that rose behind Kerr's Arbour,
touched by the long shadow of its Tower when the sun moved
towards the south....
</p>

<p>
Before the steps leading to the gate of the open vault,
the escort of troopers halted and turned inwards, making a
lane for the dead man to pass through, as they rested on
arms reversed.  The coffin was lowered, again asperged by
the celebrating priest and incensed with the words:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Eco sum resurréctio et vita, qui credit in Me etiam&mdash;si
mórtuus fuerit vivet....</i>"
</p>

<p>
During the singing of the Canticle Edward Yaill led
forward Katharine Forbis.  John Hazel, standing in rank with
the bearers, caught full view of her death-white, tear-drenched
face.  Something wrenched at his heart as the priest assisting
offered her a silver shell of sacred earth, and she scattered
some upon the lid of the coffin&mdash;from which the Union Jack
with the sword and decorations were now removed.  Yaill
followed suit: some old friends and Mrs. Bell and the lawyer,
Mr. Kellar, pressed forward to take part in this significant
act.  But Katharine's eyes beckoned and Hazel's answered.
He held his palm; she poured from the silver shell&mdash;and the
soil from the Mount of Olives streamed between his fingers
in a thin brown stream, dulling the purple petals of the
violets....
</p>

<p>
And then, moving slowly under the weight of the burden,
came the slow descent of the steps leading into the vault,
where&mdash;to the solemn company of the departed&mdash;ranged upon
rock-hewn shelves in their modern oak or old-world lead,
or antique granite coffins,&mdash;Philip, last Forbis of the male line
save Julian,&mdash;supposing Julian yet to be numbered amongst
the living,&mdash;was joined with the solemn blessing of his Church.
</p>

<p>
John Hazel's stern black eyes met Yaill's grey ones, as in
unison with others they lent their strength to place the heavy
coffin on the stone shelf appointed for its repose.  When it
slid to its place, their glances again encountered.  Yaill was
livid and spent and panting, for the effort had taxed him.  But
he gave back the other's look with cold composure, brushing
a little dust from his ringed sleeve.  Then, only delaying
to replace upon the coffin its wreath of violets&mdash;he mounted
the moss-grown steps&mdash;following the celebrant&mdash;and drew
Katharine's cold hand once more within his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Attention!  Present! ... Slope arms!"
</p>

<p>
As the ponderous door of the vault was shut and locked,
the sharp voice of the commander of the escort broke the
awed silence.  The trumpeter sounded the Last Post&mdash;and
three times the ringing crash of the volley startled to flight
the rooks of the home-wood and the jackdaws of the Tower.
As the small procession of friends, mourners and clergy
returned from the burial-ground to the slow recital of the <i>De
Profundis</i>, Yaill thought bitterly:
</p>

<p>
"Out of the depths I have cried, and no One has heard me.
Yet, what had I done amiss?"
</p>

<p>
The County, with genuine regret tinging its discreetly-conventional
condolences, rolled away in its landau-limousines
or open cars.  The officiating priests,&mdash;Father Haddon of the
parish church at Birkleas,&mdash;the Father Superior of the
Benedictine Monastery,&mdash;his guest the Jesuit from Farm Place,
and Father Inghame,&mdash;pleaded an engagement to early dinner
at Scraeside.  The cars that had brought the General and his
aide, and one or two elderly County magnates, remained
outside the courtyard railings; their owners having stayed to
lunch, as did the officers of the Tweedburgh Light Horse.  At
the board, Yaill did the honours, aided by Mr. Kellar, the
Mistress of Kerr's not being present.  A strange, ungenial
banquet, crowning a strange, sorrowful day, that,&mdash;like how
many others that had preceded it,&mdash;seemed to the host to be
woven of the stuff of dreams.  Only the rosy Kellar and one
or two of the juniors grew merry over the Forbis port, while
John Hazel,&mdash;who had shortly declined all hospitable offers
of refreshment, rode back to Cauldstanes on Alec Govan's
rickety "Sunray,"&mdash;thinking of the eyes that had silently
bidden him participate in the final rite that only the nearest
share.
</p>

<p>
The reading of the Will in the dead man's library followed
the departure of the guests.  There were a few personal
legacies to friends and pensioners.  Kerr's Arbour, with its
eleven-hundred acres of moss-hag and moorland, its few
productive farms and its neglected coverts, would, did Julian
live, be Julian's, with reversion to Katharine and her heirs.
</p>

<p>
Over that windfall of £8000, rosy Mr. Kellar chuckled,
or would have, had the solemnity of the occasion allowed.  It
would apply at this juncture to pay outstanding debts of
Captain Mark's,&mdash;who had been something of a spendthrift&mdash;patch
up yawning holes in the rent-roll, where the master of
Kerr's Arbour had foregone the rents of such tenants as had
volunteered for military service&mdash;pay the expenses of the
funeral,&mdash;and swell with the balance remaining the tale of odd
thousands, that, with her mother's little fortune,&mdash;would, if
invested in four per cent War Bonds&mdash;provide Miss Forbis
with an income approximating to £700 a year.
</p>

<p>
"This is a sad day, Colonel Yaill&mdash;a sad black day for a'
of us!" said the lawyer, as Whishaw helped him into his
shaggy overcoat.  "But Gude be thanked! the warst o't is
ower.  We're looking to yoursel' now, an' to Miss Forbis, to
bring back life and happiness to Kerr's.  Ye'll be blessed in
your pairtner&mdash;" the good man was sorely henpecked&mdash;"a
sonsy, sweet body that can be relied on neither to stick nor
fling!  Not but housekeeping in these times is a trial an' a
hertbreik.  Mrs. Kellar is sore put to it by the scarceness o'
sugar an' fat.  She made ninety-eight punds of blackberry-an'-apple
jam for the Expeditionary Arrmy last September&mdash;an'
some clever billie put her up to the eking out the sugar wi'
saut.  I fand mysel' sadly the warse for having tasted it by
accident, an' Toch!&mdash;if the lads at the Front get muckle o'
that stuff intil them, I tell her she'll be fechtin' on the side o'
the Huns.  Here comes the meir an' cairt.  Is there no one
wanting a cast to Cauldstanes? ... Put in the black bag,
Erchie Whishaw, no' in the well to be overlooked, but juist
between my feet.  And Gude-bye again to ye, Colonel Yaill,
and an auld freend's love to Miss Forbis!  This has been a
black sair day for a' of us ... but thanks be to Providence!
we're at the end o't!" ...
</p>

<p>
Yaill thought as the gravel of the courtyard shirred under
the wheels of the retreating dog-cart, "More black, more sore
than the good man dreams!  And my part in it is not yet
finished.  Old Webster never conjured up a grimmer tragedy.
For at ten o'clock I lend a hand to bury Katharine's father.
Upon the stroke of three I stab the daughter to the heart.  And
having killed her love for me&mdash;at four&mdash;possibly earlier&mdash;I
say Farewell to God's Forget&mdash;unlucky Edward Yaill!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0221"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
He went to Katharine, before three o'clock, in the little oak
parlour, a panelled, chintz-hung, feminine nest that her dead
mother had loved&mdash;looking over the South garden, across the
now frozen expanse of a curlew-haunted lake.
</p>

<p>
She rose up out of her low chair by the hearthside at the
welcome sight of Edward, and at her dear look his fetters
seemed to fall from him and for one blessed minute he
forgot&mdash;in the bliss of their embrace....
</p>

<p>
Attar of roses is composed of two essential oils, both
scentless.  When these meet and mingle, a divine perfume is born.
So from the meeting of two pure and noble souls an ideal
passion is engendered.  Love that is founded on the rock of
Reality,&mdash;yet capped with the cloud-domes of Imagination,
cloaked with the glamour&mdash;exhaling the sweetness of Poetry
and Romance.
</p>

<p>
It may be that these two had loved each other too purely
for their earthly welfare.  But as they settled into talk, fond,
intimate, personal&mdash;tinged with Katharine's sacred sorrow, and
yet illuminated with their joy&mdash;it seemed to Yaill that he had
never yet tasted such happiness, as in this long-delayed,
long-desired exchange of touch and thought and feeling&mdash;this
perfect comradeship between woman and man.
</p>

<p>
Three o'clock sounded from the clock upon the mantelshelf,
a Tudor toy in enamel openwork, whose tiny chime had rung
for many a lover's meeting&mdash;and hastened many a lover's
parting&mdash;but never heralded one more tragic than was coming
now.  He raised his head from its sweet rest on her beloved
shoulder, and slowly loosed the yearning arms that had girdled
her supple waist.  Now,&mdash;now let the revelation come&mdash;the
sooner the better.  But how to bring it about? ...
</p>

<p>
Unwitting Katharine assisted here, by telling him how that
morning Dawtie, the General's old pointer-bitch, had been
found dead and already stiffened at her post outside the chapel
door.  Yaill said, scarce knowing what he uttered:
</p>

<p>
"You will be even&mdash;lonelier&mdash;without her.  You must let
me find you another dog to fill her empty place."
</p>

<p>
"Edward?"
</p>

<p>
Her sweet eyes lifted to his face.  She saw him
changed&mdash;changing.  Deep lines graven on the broad brow that had
smoothed under her kisses.  Folds of bitterness from either
wing of the large sensitive nostrils to the corners of the lips.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Edward, Dawtie was very old, and very seldom with
me.  And there are Bran and Laddie&mdash;if I should need the
companionship of dogs.  But soon now, very soon&mdash;there is
nothing to prevent it"&mdash;She looked calmly in his face as he
knelt on the rug beside her, stiffly upright, not touching her,
both hands gripping the arm of her chair&mdash;"in a very few
weeks&mdash;we shall be married, shall we not?"
</p>

<p>
He did not speak, and her eyes wavered from his, and a
blush burned over her whole fair body: for was it not the
man's part to speak such words as these?  She said again:
"Shall we not?" ... There was a terrible pause....  The
clock chimed the quarter-hour....
</p>

<p>
"Shall we not, Edward, loving as we do&mdash;after these cruel
years of delay?" ...
</p>

<p>
Unable to credit her own vision, she saw creeping into his
grey eyes&mdash;was it reluctance, distaste or dismay? ... A shock
went through her....  Rushing sounds filled her ears and
through them she heard her own voice crying to him:
</p>

<p>
"Edward! ... For God's sake, don't look at me so!
Something is wrong....  My dearest, tell me!" ...
</p>

<p>
Her arms went out to draw him close, and came back
empty.  He had drawn back, avoiding them, and risen to his
feet.  A quiver passed over his thin brown face, such as in
windless weather will ripple the sleeping surface of some
quiet forest pool.  And the question came from her that she
had never dreamed of asking:
</p>

<p>
"Is it that you do not love me&mdash;in the marriage sense&mdash;any
more?  Am I nothing but a friend? ... Answer....  I
command you&mdash;answer!"
</p>

<p>
Yaill's face was drawn and grey.  He said,&mdash;keeping stiff
control upon the muscles of his lips:
</p>

<p>
"You are the one woman I worship....  I have never
known another whose person so charms me, whose nature so
appeals to me,&mdash;whose mind is so clear and full,&mdash;whose
sympathy is so warm, so sweet, whose soul so answers to
mine&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Edward!" ...
</p>

<p>
All reassured, she breathed the name in a tone of exquisite
tenderness.  He made her a sign that he had not done, and
went slowly on:
</p>

<p>
"I have desired&mdash;desire you now as man desires the woman
he worships.  When our marriage was postponed by the
death of your mother&mdash;when the Regiment was ordered to
India and you could not leave your father&mdash;when this
thrice-accursed War burst on the world in a blizzard of fire and
steel, and I had to leave you almost at the church-door&mdash;God
is my witness that I suffered!  Far more than I could tell you,
Katharine!"
</p>

<p>
"Love of my heart, I know it! ..."
</p>

<p>
He signed to her again for silence:
</p>

<p>
"Do not interrupt me!  All this is hard to say....  But
though my heart often cried out to you in those mad years of
filthy fighting&mdash;living, eating and sleeping&mdash;did we ever
sleep?&mdash;in the company of the Dead&mdash;while the world one had
known and lived in&mdash;the world of pretty women&mdash;decent
clothes, pleasant week-ends, jolly shooting-parties, sport, play,
good hunters and easily-running cars&mdash;seemed&mdash;except in short
flashes of intervals&mdash;to have been dead for cycles of ages&mdash;I
was buoyed up by my hopes of you, my thoughts of you&mdash;your
letters and our short rare blessed meetings.  Glimpses of
Paradise to a soul in Purgatory!  You will believe that, will
you not, Katharine?" ...
</p>

<p>
One tear glittered on his hard cheek.  Oh! to have dried
it with her kisses, and whispered comfort to her dearest,
wrought to this desperate mood by some unknown cause....
But she sat still as he had bidden, soothed by his words of
tenderness, yet with a little shivering premonition beginning
to quicken at the roots of her heart:
</p>

<p>
"Then came the Great Disaster....  Oh! why didn't I
marry you, when I got back to England&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My love," she said, "my precious dear!&mdash;I asked you to,
you know!"
</p>

<p>
He made a despairing gesture of assenting:
</p>

<p>
"And I would not accept the gift you offered in your
generosity&mdash;dear love, sweet woman!&mdash;best friend an unlucky
devil ever had or could have! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
That "Why?" came like a moan from her.  He answered
sadly:
</p>

<p>
"Because I wanted to go away alone somewhere.  To look
my new self in the face, or to recapture the lost me.
Thousands of men have felt the same&mdash;feel like that even at this
moment&mdash;coming back with raw nerves and jumbled brains
out of the hell of War."
</p>

<p>
"Then God help the women who love them!" said
Katharine Forbis.
</p>

<p>
"They will suffer," said Edward Yaill, "until they have
learned to understand the men.  As you, pearl of
women!&mdash;understood me, and pitied me.  Can I ever forget that!"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!"  She held up her hand in warning.  "Do not praise
me.  For I believed your heart had changed to me.  For a
long time I believed it, and suffered horribly....  And then
thank God, I found out one day that it was not so." ...
</p>

<p>
"When I came Home to tell you I had got back the
Regiment....  There was just time&mdash;we could have made the
time&mdash;to have got married then....  What stepped
in? ... Fate!  Was it Fate, Katharine? ..."
</p>

<p>
She knew their chance of happiness had been baulked again
as ever by the inconquerable vacillation of this brave man she
loved.  But unshaken in her loyalty, she looked back at Edward,
repeating with unfaltering lips:
</p>

<p>
"Just Fate&mdash;I suppose.  Let us leave it at that and look
forward to the Future.  And the years we may have to spend
together if it be God's Will."
</p>

<p>
Her voice blurred with held-back tears;
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;don't keep me waiting any longer, dear Edward!
I never have&mdash;never could have dreamed the possibility of
changing towards you....  But if I get more lonely&mdash;if I get
much more lonely than I am now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Was it possible that cry of tortured womanhood could have
come from Katharine?  Must she, his proud one, stoop, and
stoop to plead?  With clasped hands and yearning eyes of pain
entreating&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O Edward! don't keep me waiting long!  Think of the
years&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He said with forced deliberation:
</p>

<p>
"We may even yet have years to spend together&mdash;if you
have courage to forgive a grievous wrong!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean? ... How have you wronged? ... Have
you not told me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her voice had the sharpness of the stab he had dealt her, as
she rose up out of her fireside chair.
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you what I mean&mdash;what I meant to have spared
you, had not the man who came here yesterday with the
documents from Palestine&mdash;had not that man threatened to
tell you if I did not."
</p>

<p>
"To tell me what?  Let me hear it now!  You look ill,
Edward!"
</p>

<p>
"To tell you that I am married!" said Edward Yaill....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As she stood before him, straight and tall, he saw the life
go out of her.  For an instant he looked on a dead, bloodless
thing.  Then the banished blood rushed back from about her
heart.  Her lips and eyes retained the look of life, but the
face was a stranger's, and not Katharine's.  Nor was it
Katharine's voice that said:
</p>

<p>
"To tell me that you are married? ... Who is she?"
</p>

<p>
He hardly recognised his own voice saying:
</p>

<p>
"She is a nurse....  She was attached to the Convalescent
Camp at B&mdash;&mdash; Base."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! ... And her name?" ...
</p>

<p>
"Lucy Burtonshaw."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! ..."
</p>

<p>
The interjection dropped from her pale lips like an icicle.
But her breeding wrapped her in an impregnable mantle of
dignity.  His sense of her new remoteness was desolating as
she asked him:
</p>

<p>
"And why are you here with me and not with Lucy Burtonshaw?
I beg her pardon!&mdash;I should have said, Mrs. Edward
Yaill.  Can you explain?"
</p>

<p>
"I can explain absolutely.  Whether you would believe
me&mdash;that is another thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Let&mdash;let me think! ..."  She put her hand to her forehead,
pushing back her hair with a gesture of bewilderment.
All her world lay in ruins round her, since those few sentences
had fallen from his lips....
</p>

<p>
Rejected....  Betrayed....  Cast off....  She, Katharine
Forbis, so great, so beloved, so beautiful,&mdash;the desired of
many honourable, brave, high-born, handsome and wealthy
men.  Edward Yaill had never been told how many aspirants
had sought her,&mdash;how many brilliant offers she had steadfastly
set aside.  Choosing for years to walk in maiden
loneliness&mdash;keeping her priceless treasure of splendid womanhood
stored up,&mdash;hoarded away to this unutterable end....
</p>

<p>
She moaned, and put her hand to her heart an instant when
he said she would not believe if he explained himself.  Nothing
cut deeper or more cruelly than that.  She said with the
calmness of a mortally-wounded gentlewoman:
</p>

<p>
"I have not deserved that you should so judge me....  Say
what you think is to be said for you....  This person&mdash;this
lady who is now your wife&mdash;is the nurse&mdash;unless I am
mistaken?&mdash;to whom I entrusted my letters to keep in charge for
you?"
</p>

<p>
"The same.  And she betrayed the trust....  She kept your
letters.  It was only on Thursday morning they first reached
my hands."  Always chary of gesture, he stretched them out
to her, and drew them back and clenched&mdash;and let them fall
again.  "But for the accident of my getting the last letter you
wrote me, upon the morning I was discharged from the
Convalescent Camp&mdash;I might never have known&mdash;never
remembered&mdash;"  His voice broke.  He turned away and leaned upon
the mantelshelf, and bowed his shamed head over his folded
arms.
</p>

<p>
"Edward! ..."
</p>

<p>
Her hand went out and lightly touched his shoulder.  He
thrilled at the tone in which she spoke his name:
</p>

<p>
"Edward, tell everything, and I will listen! ..."
</p>

<p>
He said in a choked voice, averting his face from her that
she might not see the tears that brimmed and fell:
</p>

<p>
"God bless you for your mercy to me, Katharine! ... But
the story is so wild and so incredible&mdash;I dare not hope for
your entire belief....  You have believed in my devoted love
for you....  I have lived, all these years, for you alone....
Yet last Thursday, when I awakened from that strange
illusion&mdash;in the room at that Coombe Bay hotel"&mdash;Katharine
shuddered&mdash;"I was married," he made a despairing
gesture,&mdash;"married to a poor, weak, commonplace girl."
</p>

<p>
"She is your wife....  You are bound to remember it...."
</p>

<p>
He said:
</p>

<p>
"I have done so far more than she deserves....  I have
written to my solicitors&mdash;have provided for her generously....
Do not think me capable of leaving her to poverty....
But I cannot&mdash;will not share my life with her! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Loneliness can be worse to bear than poverty.  And&mdash;once
again&mdash;remember&mdash;she is your wife!"
</p>

<p>
"She is welcome to what good may be got from that
position!  She has schemed for it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Be just to her....  You have owned to me that you told
her you were poor.  Why? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven knows why&mdash;or Hell!  I have no answer....
But she had only to ask&mdash;to make inquiries&mdash;to be
enlightened on the subject of my money!"
</p>

<p>
Chivalrous Katharine flashed out in defence of her
enemy.
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose the surgeons at the Camp would have
told her?  Or that your medical report would have supplied
such details?  Or do you think Burke's '<i>Landed Gentry</i>' is
a work of reference accessible to nurses? ..."
</p>

<p>
He broke out with whirling words&mdash;frantic asseverations.
He would get a divorce....  A suit for Nullity could be
obtained under the circumstances&mdash;once the circumstances should
be made clear.  Another touch of contempt frosted her tone
as she said to him:
</p>

<p>
"The marriage is legal.  And though you seem to have
forgotten your religion&mdash;when you speak of divorce to me, I
must ask you to remember that I am a Catholic woman,
Colonel Yaill!"
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me! ..."
</p>

<p>
He sat down haggard and exhausted....  She, too,
resumed her seat, for her strength was failing fast....  And
so they sat in a sorrowful-grim travesty of the old happy
comradeship.  She looked so sorrow-stricken and yet so sweet as
she sat there in her mourning for her lost one,&mdash;that the heart
of Yaill was more than ever tortured by the fierce agony of
hopeless love.
</p>

<p>
"Think!&mdash;" he said to her desperately, "for I cannot....
Is there no way of escape from this horrible pitfall into which
I have tumbled with open eyes?  Think! ... Or cannot you
think of anything, Katharine? ..."
</p>

<p>
She said to him gently:
</p>

<p>
"Wait....  I will think, and tell you presently....  Only
wait and be patient a little, my poor dear!"
</p>

<p>
For she could not withhold her compassion and forgiveness
from this man with the furrowed face of anguish, and the
haunted, desperate eyes.  No longer her hero, her ideal of
perfect manliness and honour,&mdash;but a mere man, to be loved
and pitied, and made excuses for.  Or&mdash;her sick heart knew a
ray of Hope....  In her white cheeks dawned a tinge of
colour....  Was he one of the innumerable, blameless martyrs
made by the accursed War?
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0222"></a></p>

<h3>
XXII
</h3>

<p>
She could bear to live if Edward proved a martyr and not
a traitor.  Oh! let him be the other woman's husband if it
must be&mdash;as long as Katharine knew him guiltless.  She bent
her brow and set her rare mental powers of clear thought,
reasonable argument and logical deduction, to trace a mean
between a biassed partisanship and common justice....  One
had known such strange, abnormal things result from
shellshock....  And Edward loved her....  Oh! most entirely
loved her....  It would be possible to live on, empty of joy,
bare of all happiness&mdash;if Edward were a martyr....  God
send it might prove so....
</p>

<p>
She gripped the arms of her chair and shut her eyes, striving
to reconstruct the situation, assembling all the evidence upon
his side; trying to live through all those twilit months the life
of the man with the jangled nerves, and the numbed and
blunted brain....  Just, generous, noble-minded Katharine,
incapable of pettiness, great in her desolation....  She opened
her eyes, to encounter the sorrowful stare of his&mdash;and began
to speak, calmly, almost cheerfully&mdash;drawing him on insensibly
to talk to her of <i>that day</i>....
</p>

<p>
That day in September of the previous year, when in those
trenches south of Loos the First Battalion of the "Tweedburghs"
had been wiped out, almost to a man, for the second
time in the War.
</p>

<p>
"Why should you want to hear that story again&mdash;and now?"
he pleaded: "My God, don't ask me to tell it now! ..."
</p>

<p>
But she asked it with her steady eyes upon him; and he
obeyed her with knitted brows and twitching lips and cold
sweat upon his face:
</p>

<p>
"The Germans had started shelling our front-line parapet
at 5.30 that morning....  At a rough calculation they pounded
us with eleven hundred guns....  Half the battalion were in
the front line, and half in supports.  And we had been given
instructions to hold those trenches at any cost...."
</p>

<p>
He licked his dry lips and threw her a dog-like glance of
entreaty.  But she waited inexorably and he went on:
</p>

<p>
"We had taken them by assault and we weren't willing to
lose them.  Our guns gave back Hell for leather, but we kept
getting Super-Hell.  News kept coming through to us at
Battalion Headquarters, of casualties, fresh casualties....
Always killed&mdash;hardly ever wounded! ... My God&mdash;my
God! ... And at last I and my Adjutant&mdash;Cameron-Bain&mdash;were
left at Headquarters with a few orderlies, cooks and
bottle-washers.  We'd sent up practically every man through the
barrage to help 'em carry on....  And all my officers were
killed except two.  Jameson and Kinray-Heptown, the officers
in charge of the Advanced Line Wireless and Telephone
Communications.  Don't ask to hear the rest.  What good can it
do? ..."
</p>

<p>
"It is my right," she answered him, "to hear this story from
you....  And I am waiting...."
</p>

<p>
So he went on:
</p>

<p>
"There came a minute when Cameron-Bain and I stared
at each other blankly across a pit of horror.  We found the
Advanced Line Communications getting queer and dribbling
into incoherency....  Then they stopped....  And we knew
that the worst had happened&mdash;though we waited, hoping
against hope that Kinray-Heptown would speak again.  Then
we tossed up a penny to decide which of us&mdash;  This
hurts! ... Must I carry through with it to the end? ..."
</p>

<p>
Her great maternal heart wept tears of blood for him.
But yes....  For his sake she compelled him to carry
through....
</p>

<p>
"I called 'Tails' and won, though Bain swore I hadn't....
Then we shook hands and I went up through the German
barrage.  Trains of stretcher-bearers and wounded&mdash;our
stretcher-bearers and our wounded&mdash;lay dead upon that
horrible road....  And I got to Supports&mdash;and found them
evacuated, except for the Dead&mdash;there were plenty of dead men!
Gas was being sent over from our Advanced trench by
somebody&mdash;the wind being in our favour&mdash;if nothing else was!  But
the German guns kept on sending over High Explosive&mdash;5.9
shell&mdash;and shrapnel: and the fire of their machine-guns&mdash;they
were enfilading us from two angles&mdash;came at us like a solid
wall of lead! ..."
</p>

<p>
He wetted his parched lips and rubbed his forehead.  And
still she waited for him to tell the rest.
</p>

<p>
"I got to the Advanced trenches....  Hardly even challenged!
The few men left alive there looked at me as if I'd
been a ghost.  But they carried on, and I pushed through to
the T. &amp; W. dug-out, to find it had been blown in by a High
Velocity Shell.  Kinray-Heptown, our T.C.O., lay
dead&mdash;sprawling over the table, his blood and brains and so on&mdash;all
mixed up horribly with the <i>débris</i>.  And his assistant&mdash;Jameson&mdash;was
in the same case.  But the Wireless and telephone
installations were in working-trim,&mdash;so I took them both
over&mdash;receiving and transmitting messages in Morse Code from
the connected Advanced Posts through Cameron-Bain to Brigade
Headquarters, until one by one they left off talking, and
I took off the head-band and put down the receiver&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He might have but now come in out of the rain, his haggard
face so streamed with wet....
</p>

<p>
"Because I knew they were all dead and that I was alone....
Then a blaze of hot yellow light filled the place&mdash;and the
table reared on its hind-legs&mdash;and Kinray-Heptown&mdash;dead as
stone and covered with blood, and with his skull&mdash;you
know!&mdash;I've told you!&mdash;Heptown stood bolt upright a second&mdash;and
then went for me!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed, the loud, unnaturally harsh laugh that had
startled Katharine on the night of his arrival....
</p>

<p>
"High Explosive plays queer tricks.  Another 5.9 shell had
landed in the dug-out&mdash;and I was pinned down with Heptown
on top of me&mdash;and the heavy case of the Wireless outfit on
top of him&mdash;and the corrugated zinc, and sandbags, and earth
of the roof on top of all!  And I lay there with his awful face
crushed down on mine, and remembered," he laughed again
harshly, "what a silly kind of ass he used to be....  Always
running after new women and howling for sympathy&mdash;because
he was such a poor devil, without a rap beyond his pay&mdash;and
hadn't a living relative in the world...."
</p>

<p>
"Edward!  O Edward! my poor love! ..."
</p>

<p>
He did not hear her voice of throbbing tenderness.  He
was passing through that unspeakable ordeal again:
</p>

<p>
"A dismal man.  They called him 'Gummidge' in the Regiment,
and the nickname fitted the beggar to a 'T.'  How I
crawled out from under him ... can't imagine for the life of
me!  Probably my tin hat saved me from smothering....
They say I'd not a rag on when they found me&mdash;yellow as a
guinea from melinite and smeared with blood&mdash;not mine, but
Heptown's!  Poor devil!&mdash;not a rap beyond his pay&mdash;not a
living soul belonging to him in the world! ..."
</p>

<p>
He shuddered, and knitted his hands together closely, and
so sat rigid&mdash;battling with some invisible power that strove
with him for mastery of will....
</p>

<p>
"Edward! ..."
</p>

<p>
She was kneeling by his chair,&mdash;her arms wrapped round
about him, her cheek to his,&mdash;the swell and heave of her
bosom close to his&mdash;her warmth and sweetness his&mdash;all his
once more....
</p>

<p>
"All is quite clear to me now.  You have not wronged me!
You are blameless&mdash;my man of men!  Listen, dear Edward!
In some way strange to us, clear to neurologists&mdash;when you
lay buried alive, pinned down helpless by the body of that
poor dead officer, the horror of those dreadful minutes&mdash;or
hours&mdash;stamped his personality&mdash;branded it, I might better
say&mdash;upon your memory so that you could not forget it if you
would!  The story you told to that poor girl afterwards&mdash;your
conviction that you were poor, unloved and friendless&mdash;all
came from that&mdash;were part of the strange obsession.  Dear,
in my eyes you are quite blameless.  Forgive me, Edward,
if"&mdash;he felt the sob she bravely kept back&mdash;"in the first agony
of hearing what you have told me&mdash;I let myself feel resentful
towards you!"
</p>

<p>
"Katharine!"
</p>

<p>
He drew a great breath of relief, and his load was lightened.
She believed....  Oh, wonder of wonders, she believed....
He faltered:
</p>

<p>
"Then you do not hate and despise me? ..."
</p>

<p>
Her swift kiss touched his hands.  He heard her saying:
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I admire, I love, I worship you!&mdash;my
hero, my martyr&mdash;my King&mdash;my man of men! ..."
</p>

<p>
"KATHARINE!"
</p>

<p>
In the rapture of that declaration Yaill would have
embraced her; clasped her close to his starving heart and covered
her with caresses.  But she freed herself from him gently
and with decision, though he pleaded humbly for a single
kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Dear, when we say Good-bye, then I will kiss you.  It is
my right, I shall not waive my claim.  We were husband and
wife in soul if not in actuality&mdash;we are parted&mdash;not through
any mutual change of feeling, but by an act of the inscrutable
Will of God.  You have a wife&mdash;it is for us to remember it!&mdash;and
so I ask you to go away from here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'Go!' ... Leave you now? ..."
</p>

<p>
His face grew hard and obstinate.
</p>

<p>
"Why should I leave you?  Do we not love each other?
Have we not, as you say yourself, been one in heart for all
these years! ... We have done no wrong, so why should we
suffer?  And, if I leave you, where am I to go?  Not back to
that woman? ..."
</p>

<p>
A spasm contracted her white face to a pinched mask of
jealousy.  He hardly knew the voice that came through the
clenched teeth and stiffened lips:
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  She <i>is</i> your wife!"
</p>

<p>
"My wife through a vulgar deceit.  Don't say you hold
her guiltless?"
</p>

<p>
"Almost, if she believed you!" she forced herself to say.
</p>

<p>
"And this is your love!" he snarled at her, stung to injustice.
</p>

<p>
She answered&mdash;and the voice was once more Katharine's:
</p>

<p>
"This is my love! ..."
</p>

<p>
He wheeled to the fireplace and stood in thought, resting
his elbow on the mantelshelf.  When he looked back at her it
was to say:
</p>

<p>
"And if I obey you now and leave you, what are your plans?
What do you intend to do?"
</p>

<p>
She told him:
</p>

<p>
"I had made up my mind&mdash;supposing you had left me this
time without settling a definite date for our marriage&mdash;that I
would get drafted out to the East to help Hilda.  You
remember Lady Donnithorpe?  She was a great friend of mine, I
have often told you, when we were girls together at
Chalkcliff&mdash;fellow-pupils at the Convent of the Sisters of the Sacred
Heart....  Sir Hugo is on the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief
at Cairo.  Hilda is Commandant of the Red Cross Hospital
at Montana&mdash;seventeen miles from Alexandria&mdash;standing
in wonderful grounds.  It was formerly, or so I understand&mdash;a
palace of the ex-Khedive.  I could drive a car for them, or
nurse&mdash;I have my certificate&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have got your plans all ready cut and
dried&mdash;without much reference to me! ..."
</p>

<p>
His face was wrung as he looked round at her.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be cruel, Edward!  Do not let me remember by-and-by&mdash;that
on this day that sees me shorn of everything, you
were unkind&mdash;for the first time...."
</p>

<p>
He gave a short, impatient groan.
</p>

<p>
"Who is unkind to both of us but yourself?  But you shall
be obeyed&mdash;I will leave Kerr's Arbour."
</p>

<p>
Each of the five words gave her its separate stab.  She
never winced, but said to him unfalteringly:
</p>

<p>
"There is a train from Cauldstanes at six o'clock.  You
could catch the King's Cross Express by changing at
Carlisle...."
</p>

<p>
"And it is now four-thirty."
</p>

<p>
From habit he had glanced at the cheap watch strapped upon
his wrist....  The heavy lines between his knitted brows
deepened and a vein throbbed in his temple, as he stripped the
poor trinket from his wrist and dropped it into the glowing
heart of the fire.  The glass burst with a sharp little crack&mdash;and
the leather strap writhed among the hot, devouring flames
so like some reptile dying in torment that Katharine turned
her eyes away.  As Yaill's hard, level voice went on saying:
</p>

<p>
"From Cauldstanes, six o'clock! ... Thanks! that train
would suit me very well.  Please no&mdash;don't ring!"  Her hand
had gone out to touch the stud of the bell beside the fireplace.
"Don't trouble to order any kind of trap....  I had much
rather walk.  Some hard tramping in the frosty air will do me
good....  Really....  I should prefer it! ..."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;your luggage!" She looked at him anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"My kit! ..."  He could have laughed outright, but he
controlled himself by main force, and went on in the same stiff,
formal tone: "Send it to-morrow morning by an early train to
my Club in Pall Mall.  I shall take care to leave it properly
addressed, so that you have no trouble of any kind&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Edward....  Be just ... be fair!  Don't&mdash;torture me like
this!"
</p>

<p>
The cry broke from Katharine barely of her volition.  She
caught him by the wrists.
</p>

<p>
"How am I torturing you?" he asked her coldly.
</p>

<p>
"What have you decided to do?"  Her eyes were on a level
with his, begging, commanding.  "Tell me! ..."  She caught
him by the wrists.  "Are you going back&mdash;to her? ..."
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
Her hands had been like steel upon Yaill's wrists.  Her eyes,
tawny and fierce as those of an enraged lioness, were fixed
upon his.  The pang of pity she had felt for the poor giver
of the destroyed watch was lost in her anguished sense of her
own despoliation,&mdash;her own helpless impotence to hold her
usurped rights....  But at that deep, stern No! from him her
hands grew weak upon his wrists, and the lioness-fury in her
eyes died out and left them tender....
</p>

<p>
"I have said to you that I cannot share my life with her&mdash;the
woman I have married.  I swear to you she shall want for
nothing&mdash;be treated honourably!  As to my plans&mdash;the most
definite is to go to the Near East and find your brother Julian.
Not to fight with Turks for the Holy Sepulchre.  My faith
is dead in me.  When God gives me back You, then I will be
friends with Him!  Until then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Edward, hush! ..."
</p>

<p>
"I will not shock you more, dearest of living women.  Give
me that one last kiss, and say: 'Good luck to you on your
road!'  For at the end of the road I may find your brother
Julian.  In some Turkish prison&mdash;enclosure or labour-camp,
working under the lash.  Now will you kiss&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not here, dear Edward! ..."
</p>

<p>
She draped her head with the black-lace veil that had been
her dead mother's, and smiled&mdash;how could she bear to
smile?&mdash;as she held out her hand....
</p>

<p>
"We will say our Good-bye in the chapel....  Come, my
dearest! ..."
</p>

<p>
He could not resist her look, her touch....  Together, they
went out....
</p>

<p>
The fragrance of incense was sweet in the still place, the
treasure-chamber of this Catholic dwelling; where you felt the
Blessed Sacrament as a guarded Flame, a vital Essence, a
Presence mysterious and impalpable, yet instinct with latent
Power and conserved Force.  When Katharine bowed in
adoration of her Lord and Master, Yaill stood erect, silently defying
Him,&mdash;with set jaws and scowling brows, and hard glittering
eyes.
</p>

<p>
But when Katharine rose, and again took his hand, his icy
armour melted.  His eyes softened and he yielded to her touch
like a big, docile child.  She drew him to the small
Communion-rail&mdash;knelt on the worn red cushion, and was silent;
gathering strength to speak, fighting with her anguish; while
the haggard frowning man stood stiffly waiting at her side.
</p>

<p>
A moment more and Katharine's low voice flowed out upon
the silence.  She said, to the Living Presence in the Veiled
Tabernacle:
</p>

<p>
"My Saviour and my God, Thou seest at Thy Footstool two
of Thy servants, who after long years of love and fidelity,
and patient waiting and hopes often frustrated, are parted&mdash;for
life perhaps&mdash;as if Death had come between.  We do not
know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The sweet voice wavered and then went on steadily:
</p>

<p>
"We do not know why we must suffer&mdash;we only know it is
Thy Will.  And we offer Thee&mdash;O give us strength to offer
Thee! this agony of parting&mdash;in submission to Thy Majesty
and in expiation of our sins&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What sins?" Yaill asked her in a deep, stern voice.
</p>

<p>
She seemed not to hear, and went on speaking:
</p>

<p>
"The sins that we weak mortals have committed in our
lives.  And now to Thy care, Who didst offer Thyself a
living Sacrifice for the redemption of the world upon the Altar
of the Cross&mdash;I commend my beloved whom Thou hast taken
from me!  Preserve him in body and in soul from every sort
of danger.  Guide him, guard him&mdash;lead him upon his path
in life....  And if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She heard Yaill's boot-heel grind upon the stone, and knew
that he was trembling....
</p>

<p>
"Let this end! ..." he said below his breath.  "Do you
hear me!  End now, Katharine! ..."
</p>

<p>
But she went on, fighting,&mdash;had he known the truth,&mdash;for
the soul of him, her dearest:
</p>

<p>
"And if we may never be one on earth, O let us be one
in Heaven! ..."
</p>

<p>
Yaill gritted his teeth savagely, and a rending sob tore
through his frame.  The tears were streaming down his face
as he stammered out to her, gulping and choking:
</p>

<p>
"Lend me ... hanky ... Kathy!  I can't find&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She gave him her handkerchief as a mother might a child,
and went resolutely on to the end of her prayer.
</p>

<p>
"And now before Thee, here present in the Blessed Sacrament
as truly as when Thou didst walk with Thy Beloved
upon this sorrowful earth,&mdash;I promise to be faithful to Edward
Yaill my lover, in body and soul, through Life till Death, and
in the Eternal Life! ..."
</p>

<p>
He gave a hoarse inarticulate cry and sank to his knees beside
her.  She turned and folded him in her arms, and his face
sank on her bosom, and the black-lace veil that draped her
head fell over his too.  It smelt of violets.  His scalding tears
wetted her neck....  She lifted his face and kissed him,&mdash;with
all her soul kissed him.  But a fold of her mother's
black-lace veil came between her mouth and his.
</p>

</h3>

<p>
Long after Edward Yaill had gone, and Night had settled
down upon Kerr's Arbour, old James Whishaw hobbled noiselessly
into the chapel to find Katharine kneeling there.  He
bent his own stiff rheumatic knees upon a chair behind her,
and waited, and said a prayer for the daughter of his dead
master, dear to him as a daughter of his own.  Her face
was hidden in her hands, her lace veil fell over them.  No
movement stirred its patterned folds, no sigh nor sob escaped
her....  She might have been the statue of a kneeling woman,
wrought in black marble or ebony.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Forbis, mem!" the ancient servitor whispered after
an interval.  There was no response.  Grown desperate, he
ventured a fresh appeal.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Katharine! ... Miss Kathy, for your ain sake!&mdash;for
a' our sakes&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The quavering terror in the cracked, familiar voice reached
her.  She stirred, and answered:
</p>

<p>
"You, Whishaw? ... Am I wanted? ... Who&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She tried to rise to her feet, but could not.  The old man
hurried to her and lent his feeble strength to help her, and
she rose up and they came out of the church together, slowly,
arm in arm.  As the door swung-to behind them, she put back
her veil and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Has Colonel Yaill?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The butler hardly recognised the drained white face she
turned to him.  Her voice was a mere thread of sound, the
shadow of itself.
</p>

<p>
"He has gone this hoor an' mair," he said, "an' a wire has
juist come for him.  My bairn&mdash;Miss Katharine, dearie!&mdash;there
is anither for him that's gane!  An' O I doot bad news in
baith, by word the bringer dropped wi' them&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Give me the wires....  I understand...." she said.  "The
messenger has gossiped?"
</p>

<p>
"They're weel kent for loose-tongued, claverin' bodies at
Cauldstanes Post Office," owned Whishaw, adding bitterly:
"Nor ye'll no' bind Discretion on Meggy Proodfoot, wi' the
King's Croon on her airm."  He took the salver with the
two orange envelopes from a console table in the hall, and
brought it to his mistress, entreating: "Gin' ye could see yer
ain face ye wad be frichtit, Miss Katharine.  Let me get ye
a glass o' wine before ye'se open them, my lamb!"
</p>

<p>
But Katharine mingled no juice of the grape with this, her
latest draught of the strong black wine of Sorrow.  She opened
the envelope that bore Yaill's name, and by the light of the
great wood fire that blazed in the hall hearthplace, deciphered
the message it contained.
</p>

<p>
"This must be re-telegraphed to Edward's London Club,"
flashed through her mind before the vile sense of the words
upon the sheet drove clearly home to her; and then she started
as though their concentrated venom had seared to the very
bone.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Have discovered where you are.  Return instantly or I
shall follow.  Your wife, Lucy Yaill.  Tor View, Coombe
Bay.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A moment Katharine staggered under the shock.  Then with
the fierce blood burning in her cheeks, she won her shaken
composure back, saying as she encountered the Watery blue
stare of her ancient servitor:
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing to trouble us in this.  I know it to be
not important."  And she crumpled up the flimsy sheet and
dropped it into the midmost of the fire, adding: "We will not
trouble Colonel Yaill by forwarding it at all."
</p>

<p>
Then she opened the other orange envelope.  It held a
communication from the Casualty Department at the War
Office, and told her with official brevity that her brother Julian
was dead.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Regret to inform news received from eye-witness confirms
report that Father Julian Forbis, O.S.G., R.C. Chaplain &mdash;th
Brigade, 29th Division, Mediterranean Forces, Gallipoli, was
killed on August 21st by direct hit Turkish shrapnel shell
during storming of Scimitar Hill.  No remains recoverable.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She read out the withering message of disaster in a low
clear voice devoid of a trace of expression.  The butler and the
servants who had gathered in the hall broke into sobs and
lamentations.  But what avail are tears and outcries?  They are
only of use to vent the sorrow that is neither poignant or
profound.  Miss Forbis went to the drawing-room and penned
some telegrams; one to the Father Superior of Julian's Monastery
at Clerport, one to Julian's dearest friend, in the trenches
before Arras,&mdash;a brief note to the lawyer and notary,
Mr. Kellar,&mdash;already (through that local Post Office leakage) in
possession of the intelligence,&mdash;and a third telegram for Colonel
Edward Yaill, addressed to his London Club.
</p>

<p>
And then, moving mechanically as an automaton, she went
from the room, encountered Whishaw and gave the messages
to be taken into Cauldstanes that night by a mounted groom.
The wires to be left at the private house of the postmaster
for despatch in the early morning; the note to be handed to
Mr. Kellar, sitting with his old cronies over his toddy and
his well-loved rubber of whist.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bell, Miss Forbis's elderly companion (worn out by
the day's sorrowful ceremonial) had long retired to her room.
Time enough to break the news to her upon the following
morning.  Katharine ordered the wearied servants to shut
up the house and go to bed, and herself set the example.
But when her tearful maid had quitted her for the night,
reluctantly and wistfully,&mdash;she could not bear the notion of lying
down in that now desolate house to rest.  It stifled her.  So
she dressed again,&mdash;threw over all a hooded woollen mantle,
took a small electric lantern and went out of the room....
</p>

<p>
To ascend above the level of ordinary daily existence, to
climb a height and draw into the lungs long breaths of purer
air, seems to be a craving shared by not only those whose
bodies are racked and worn by chronic suffering, but by those
others who in heart and soul are wrung by mental pain.  The
Lawgiver of Israel ascended into the fastnesses of Sinai&mdash;not
only to receive the commands of the Most High&mdash;but to hide
his anguish at the backslidings of his rebellious people&mdash;turning
to unholy commerce with Egyptian god-devils and Canaanitish
idols,&mdash;from the pure worship of the One God.  And His
Son was wont to climb the solitary heights of mountains, when
He was weary with the healing of multitudes&mdash;and oppressed
with His burden of human woe!  And since His day, how
many others have known the need, and sought the same
alleviation:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When on the heights I drink the air<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch the budding of each star<br>
  Out of the dusk, this grief I bear<br>
  Is somewhat soothed; my load of care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightens, and Thou art not so far&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Descending to the ground-floor, Katharine, barely of her own
volition, passed through a small, heavy baize-covered door at
the northern end of the hall.  It led into the Tower, and she
crossed a great stone-flagged, stone-vaulted room lighted by
narrow window-slits high in the massive stone walls, unlocked
another door with a key that was in the lock, huge and
old-fashioned, but oiled and working smoothly, and came out at
the foot of the narrow stone stairway that spiralled, storey by
storey, to the top of the Tower.
</p>

<p>
She was weary, but the turmoil and anguish of her spirit
set the claims of the body out of court.  She moved on, tall
and stern and beautiful, flashing her guiding light on a jutting
stone in the wall here, or a broken step there,&mdash;just as though
she were conducting some visitor to admire the famous view
from the battlements.
</p>

<p>
The young moon of February rode high in the southern
heavens.  The Standard hung at half-mast from the flagstaff
of the Tower.  There was little wind to stir its heavy pendent
folds, what there was came almost balmily in drifts from the
west.
</p>

<p>
Some belated workman or field-labourer was going home
across the policy,&mdash;or possibly some gamekeeper or shepherd
may have been setting out upon his nightly rounds.  The
night being dark and still, he sang; perhaps because he was
sorrowful, possibly because he was happy; it may have been
to cheer his loneliness.  But whoever he was, he had a voice;
a sweet, if untutored baritone,&mdash;and the matchless beauty and
poignant pathos of "The Land o' the Leal" beat in wave upon
wave of anguish, and sorrow, and yearning, upon Katharine's
tortured soul....
</p>

<p>
"O God!" she cried aloud in her anguish, "I cannot bear
it.  Desolate, desolate, stripped bare of everything! ... All of
them taken!&mdash;Mark and my father, and to-day Edward! ... O
Edward, my love! and Julian! ... Ah! ..."
</p>

<p>
And her own cry was flung back from the battlements, so
thin, so weirdly eldritch that she shuddered at the sound....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Madness was near my Katharine in that hour of abandonment.
But when the wild spirit of Marioun Forbis, whose
tragic tale I have not time to tell here, cried to her: "Be bold!
One leap will end it!" and the thin ghostly hands of proud,
sinful Countess Edith plucked at her garments to drag her
to the battlements; and Mistress Juliana, who starved herself
to death for grief because her too-severely punished babe
had died in a fit in the dark cupboard where it had been
shut up after a whipping, lent her impalpable, invisible aid to
urge her kinswoman to the desperate deed,&mdash;the saintly Mother
St. Edward, Abbess of the Brigittine Convent of Syon
(stripped of all and driven thence to exile with her Community
by the edict of fierce Elizabeth), whispered of submission to
the Divine Will.  And heroic Madam Lucy&mdash;who nursed her
smitten household back to life through the days when the Great
Plague raged in England,&mdash;and only lay down to die at length
when all she loved were safe,&mdash;leaned to her ear and
whispered "Courage!" and countless other noble women of her
ancient race gathered about her then....
</p>

<p>
And at last the memory of her own lost, beloved mother rose
up to aid her, and the Mother of All Mothers&mdash;pitying her
faithful daughter's anguish&mdash;interceded with Her Divine Son
that the gift of prayer might be restored to ease the breaking
heart....
</p>

<p>
It came like a spate among the hills after long drought, and
Katharine fell upon her knees, and leaned her aching head
against the rough-hewn stone, and told God all her trouble,
and knew that He heard....  Then she rose up calmed and
comforted, and so went down the Tower stair and back to her
bedroom.  And slept and dreamed of a gigantic man,&mdash;tawny-brown
of skin, and with a vast black beard, fierce black eyes
and a great hooked nose exactly like John Hazel's,&mdash;wrapped
in a vast hooded mantle&mdash;carrying an iron-shod staff like
St. Christopher's&mdash;and wearing immense boots such as are never
seen now.  He went before her over a desert which she needs
must traverse, seeking for the lost Julian&mdash;a waved expanse
of scorching yellow sand, peopled by ugly Things that lived in
burrows, and kept popping up their diabolical horned heads
to mock and gibe at Katharine....  Then the Bearded One
stood in the midst of a raging torrent (which it seemed that
Katharine must negotiate), and leaned on his immense staff to
steady himself, stretching out the other hand to help her
across....  There was a black onyx intaglio of Hercules in
an antique setting of greenish gold on his huge forefinger....
And his vast hand, as it enfolded hers, felt warm and
friendly and kind.  And she asked, for the black eyes under
the dense black brows were more like than ever:
</p>

<p>
"You're John Hazel, really, aren't you? ..."
</p>

<p>
And the huge man answered, in a booming bass, showing
great white teeth in the thicket of his hirsuteness:
</p>

<p>
"Nay, daughter of the race of him I loved!  But John
Hazaël is of me!"

<p>
Wonderful times, these of which I write, fruitful in
world-shaking happenings, hecatombs of slaughtered men;
sledge-hammer strokes of Fate and Destiny.  Sudden descents of
long-suspended swords upon anointed heads.  Tragedies, calamities,
dazzling adventures, murders and massacres, high deeds
of patriotism, stirring deeds of heroism, wakening admiration,
pity or terror.  Who shall marvel that into this whirlpool of
great events the Mysterious Disappearance of A Well Known
British Commanding Officer (as recorded by the Press under
the above and similar headings) dropped with as little sensation
as the fall of a pair of binoculars from an aviator's hand.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Staying at Kerr's Arbour, N.B."&mdash;I quote from one of the
newspaper paragraphs, "the officer, a well-known personality
in Society, possessing a great record of distinguished service
with the famous Tweedburgh Regiment of Infantry, left the
house at which he was an honoured guest, after the funeral
of Sir Philip Forbis, which he had attended in the morning,
and has not been since heard of.  It transpires that Colonel
Yaill had intended to walk to Cauldstanes Station, for the
purpose of taking a late afternoon train to the junction of
Carlisle.  He had ordered his luggage to be forwarded to his
London Club on the morning following, and carried with him
nothing but a trench-coat and a walking-stick.  The calamity
which has again befallen the 'Tweedburghs' since the appointment
of Colonel E. A. Yaill to command the regiment, will be
fresh in the sympathetic memory of every reader.  On
September 1915, Colonel Yaill made his way to the front-line
trenches through a blizzard of German H.E. and finding of
the few living men left in them not one unwounded, took over
and carried on the Telephone and Wireless Communications
with Brigade and Divisional H.Q. until for the second time
the dug-out containing the installations was blown in by a
High Velocity shell.  Severe shock was sustained by the gallant
officer, who was discovered later, alive but quite dazed,
and taken to Hospital.  Since then he has successfully
undergone treatment at the B&mdash;&mdash; Base Hospital Camp, which he
quitted little more than a week ago, with a convalescent
discharge.  To add to the strange interest, and thicken the
mystery of the case, it has transpired that on the morning he left
the Hospital Camp at B&mdash;&mdash; the missing officer was married
to a young and attractive lady, by name Miss Lucy Burtonshaw,
serving with her Red Cross Unit at the B&mdash;&mdash; Base
Convalescent Camp, as a certified nurse.  Up to the present we
can only record that whether the disappearance of Colonel
Yaill may be ascribed to foul play, or a sudden loss of
memory, no clue has been discovered up-to-date which throws any
light upon his whereabouts.  At his country home, 'The
Grange,' Scraefell, N. Cumberland, his sisters, the Misses
Olive and Isabella Yaill, are in the utmost distress and anxiety
regarding his probable fate.  At his Club <i>The Services</i>, in
Pall Mall, no communication has been received from him, nor
can his brother, Mr. Anthony Yaill, K.C., or Sir Arthur Ely,
head of the eminent firm of Ely and Ely, for many years
solicitors to the Yaill family, supply any information
whatever concerning the missing officer."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Private John Hazel, returned to the bosom of his family
at Campden Hill, read this, or a similar paragraph, in the
morning Wire, and somewhere towards forenoon of the same day,
received a telegram, the perusal of which gave him another
unexpected thrill.  It ran as follows:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Can you come?  In great anxiety.  Katharine Forbis Kerr's
Arbour T.O.  Cauldstanes Tweedburgh N.B.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He had written a brief, business-like note from the <i>Cross
Keys Hotel</i> on the day of his return from her father's funeral,
taking leave of Miss Forbis, repeating his offer of service,
and enclosing an address from whence, in case of need, he
might always be communicated with.  Strangely soon the call
had come.  Strangely natural, as in the run of long-accustomed
things it seemed to be responding to the appeal, to answer
by the messenger waiting the reply:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Thank you.  Coming by next train.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He pitchforked a few necessaries into a battered suit-case,
left a pencilled note upon the lid of Mrs. Hazel's large,
responsible Red Cross work-basket&mdash;for his mother now invariably
left home directly after breakfast, for the Work Rooms in
Mayfair&mdash;where, in the delectable company of Duchesses&mdash;she
spent the hours in the manufacture of Life-Saving Waistcoats
for the Fleet, and felt Hospital slippers, until six-thirty.
Consuming luncheon, carried in a plated box, and rigorously
relegated to such forms of nourishment as may without reproach
be assimilated by patriotic British digestive organs in War-time;
taking a frugal tea on the scene of activity; and returning
at seven to partake of a dinner of generous succulence.
Having thus discharged his duty as a son, John departed by taxi
for King's Cross, catching the very next express leaving for
the North....
</p>

<p>
The room he had previously occupied at the <i>Cross Keys</i> was
vacant.  He stepped into its queer conglomeration of ancient
smells, and the glass-eyed society of the birds and beasts and
fishes in their musty cases, and it might have been that he
had never gone away, but that Mrs. Govan in person served
his supper in the clammy coffee-room, a part-knitted
khaki-coloured sock, bristling with steel knitting-needles, tucked
under a stout arm, and the ball bulging the pocket of her apron
of black silk.
</p>

<p>
"Eh, dear!"  Mrs. Govan had ceased to address John as
"Private" since she had realised his somewhat indeterminate
yet undeniable connection with "the family" at Kerr's.  "Eh,
Mr. Hazel! but this is grievous! ... And to think that I met
Cornel Yaill wi' the meir an' cart the vera' nicht he cam' down
to atten' the Funeral.  Gin' auld Sir Philip cud have kent!
But Providence was mercifu'.  And sair it has irkit me to
think o' Miss Forbis a' alane there at Kerr's, like the last
aipple on the strippit tree, as I hae said to Govan, an'
telegrams rattlin' ower the wires wi' 'Reply Paid' to the lave o'
them&mdash;from a' the warld and's wife, beggin' an' prayin' till
her: 'Darling Katharine, let us come to you, or if not, winna
you come to us,' and gettin' answer: 'A thousand thanks, but
no.  Lovingly, Katharine.'  An' sae, when I e'en kent she had
sent for ye, I juist drew a free sough."
</p>

<p>
Evidently there had been a serious leakage from the Cauldstanes
Telegraph Office.  John mentally registered the evidence
as Mrs. Govan continued:
</p>

<p>
"Ye'll have haird the latest news o' Cornel Yaill, dootless?"
</p>

<p>
"Has he been found?" her guest inquired, eliciting the shrill
disclaimer:
</p>

<p>
"Na, na!  We'se hae the Police traipsin' in an' out the
bar makin' their inquiries&mdash;an' the wee laddies in the short
breeks&mdash;the Boy Scouts I suld say! scoorin' ower the face o'
the lan', but neither bone nor feather o' the man hae they
fand for a' their pains!  And mair nor me an' Govan thinks,"
she pursed her lips mysteriously, "that it'll be no' for's ain
guid when they rin the Cornel doon&mdash;wherever's his hidie-hole!
Weel free o' siccan a mislaird rogue Miss Forbis may
coont hersel!  Marriet on a stranger wumman&mdash;faugh!&mdash;an'
the bauld, traipsin' craitur huntin' him doon, un' telegrams to
the verra door o' Kerr's Arbour.  'Have knowledge whaur ye
are.  Return instantly, or I will follow.  Your wife, Lucy
Yaill.'  Set her up for a shameless hussy!&mdash;an' the brawest
leddy in Tweedshire&mdash;ay', an' the haill o' Scotland&mdash;wi' grand,
gentlemen many a ane etchin' to pit a ring on the white hand
o' her&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Govan broke off in the midst of her tirade with a
sense of genuine alarm.  For the blazing black eyes under the
heavy brows of John Hazel were sternly set upon her; and
the great hooked nose&mdash;"siccan glowering e'en, an' siccan a
hawk's neb!&mdash;eneuch to fricht a body!" seemed fraught with
threatenings of doom to come.  He said in his deep voice:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Forbis will hardly thank you for your praise of herself
personally, if you couple with it such confoundedly libellous
abuse of her nearest and dearest friend."
</p>

<p>
"Guidsake! ... I'm sure I never thocht....  To be sure
naething is kenned for certain....  Ye'll keip it frae Miss
Forbis, sir, if I said onything to offend! ..." and the flurried
woman bumped down the dish upon the cloth and vanished,
leaving John Hazel wondering why on earth he had stuck up
for the man.
</p>

<p>
He slept with the stuffed birds and beasts that night, and next
morning, after breakfast, the mare Brownie being under the
veterinary for a chill, the old black horse, her stable-companion,
having been sent to the blacksmith's for roughing,
and Alec Govan's motor-cycle having been requisitioned
for the postman's uses&mdash;John set out on foot for Kerr's Arbour.
</p>

<p>
It was piercing cold; the east wind carried the bitter tang
of the North Sea, the country lay under a fresh cloak of
new-fallen snow, and the chilled thrushes and blackbirds and robins
huddled disconsolately in the cropped hedges, and the low
bushes and plumps of ivy swaddling old tree-stumps in the
plantations by the roadside.  As John Hazel's long active legs
left the miles behind&mdash;what was a road ankle-deep in snow
to a Territorial who had wintered in Flemish trenches!&mdash;he
wondered somewhat as to the nature of the service Katharine
Forbis would require at his willing hands.
</p>

<p>
Help, it might prove, in some further efforts to gain
intelligence of the man who had vanished so suddenly....  Who
could not be traced, nor ever would be, until the body should
be found....  For Edward Yaill was dead, most certainly.
Once Katharine Forbis had showed you plainly she despised
you, how could you bear to live any more?  Yaill had had that
much of manhood left in him.  So he had gone out with a
definite purpose,&mdash;and in some dense plantation, or lonely
granite quarry, thick-draped with curtains of bramble, had
shot himself; creeping well in under the growths to be securely
hidden, and died&mdash;and there an end of him....
</p>

<p>
Odd how those miserable grey eyes, with their haunting stare
of agony, kept rising up before John Hazel, as he tramped
over the hog-backed Roman road over which how many old
dead-and-gone Forbis of Kerr's had led their bow and
spearmen against the Picts, or Viking pirates from the wild
North Sea; or pricked forth to the Wars of Balliol or Bruce&mdash;or
set out in state and pageantry, with fair ladies in painted
litters, or on gaily-caparisoned palfreys&mdash;to the Court of the
Scots' King at Stirling or Edinburgh.  And he wondered at
the strange, impersonal love he felt for them, so brave, so
bold, so tender, so gallant and gracious&mdash;from the Roman
Prætor of Alexandria&mdash;who had given the black onyx ring
to his (John Hazel's) ancestor&mdash;down to Sir Rupert the
Cavalier, and the fine old General and the lost Julian, and
Katharine....
</p>

<p>
Ah, Katharine! ... Again he saw her noble face irradiated
by the glow and glamour, the mysterious beauty that transfigure
even a plain woman when she loves with all her soul.
</p>

<p>
And then the face of Yaill, with its anguish and despair,
rose up before him clearer than ever.  He heard the
compassionate voice of the V.A.D. woman saying:
</p>

<p>
"His wretched, <i>wretched</i> eyes! ... I <i>hope</i> I'm not going to
dream of them!  Oh! there <i>must</i> be something to be said for
a man who looks like that! ..."
</p>

<p>
Suppose the man were innocent&mdash;the luckless sport of
horrible circumstances! ... Had John Hazel been of Scottish
blood, he would have said, "I'm fey."  Being what he was,
he said vigorously, "I'm a bally idiot!" and continued
tramping along the snowy road.
</p>

<p>
Past the hollow way, crossed by a strip of ice, where the
snow on the overhanging trees was thawing in long drips and
splashes, and the benumbed birds showed more active signs
of life.  Out of the hollow way, on the left a dense plantation,
on the opposite side to, and about a quarter of a mile below
the iron gate of the entrance to the Kerr's Arbour private
road.

</h3>

<p>
A whistle shrilled near by, keen, sharp and silvery.  John
Hazel stiffened at the sound, as a seasoned soldier will.  But
nothing was in sight but a wee tow-headed laddie, "a kid" John
would have called him&mdash;in a ragged suit of moleskins, cut down
from adult-sized garments, who perched on the topmost round
of the hog-backed stile leading into the plantation, and blew
a shining whistle, from which a lanyard hung.
</p>

<p>
The small boy saw John start, and thrilled with secret exultation.
To own a silver whistle and have no one to admire you
is really little better than having none at all.  So he blew
again, lustily, with one eye on the big black "soger," and John
Hazel pulled up steaming, and passed the time of day....
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, you queer little beggar, and where did you
get that whistle?" he began.
</p>

<p>
At this the small boy scrambled down from the gate, and
came to the roadside.  He was a freckled child of eight or so,
with wide gaps where first teeth had retired from the conflict,
and a nose that sadly needed wiping, and broken festering
chilblains on his swollen ears and hands.  But his sharp blue
eyes were bright on the stranger's as he answered:
</p>

<p>
"I am nae no beggar ava, but Meggy Proodfoot's wee laddie.
An' I fand the bonny whistle in yonner woodie the morn."
</p>

<p>
By the jerk of the cracked and swollen thumb John guessed
"woodie" meant plantation.  He said, blowing out his long
brown cheeks, and scowling with mock ferocity:
</p>

<p>
"That's a real soldier's whistle, not a thing for a kid to
play with.  You should give it to your daddy.  He's a soldier,
I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
The small boy returned, grinning:
</p>

<p>
"I dinna ken&mdash;for my daddie is no' a kirk daddie.  Some
say he maun be Keeper Todd, but my mother says it's no'!
She's thinkin' he's the engineer that cam' wi' the
steam-thrasher,&mdash;an' she ca's me a puir come-by-chance when she has a
drappy on.  I'm no mindin'!"  The freckled face turned up to
John's grinned hardily:
</p>

<p>
"Give me hold of that whistle a minute, you infantile
philosopher," said John Hazel, and took it in his hand.  It bore
the silver hall-mark,&mdash;was an officer's signal-whistle.  On the
butt was engraved in clear fine letters:
</p>

<p>
"E. A. Yaill (R.C.) Lieut. Col. R. Tweedburgh Infantry
Regt."
</p>

<p>
Here was the clue.  Was the secret hidden in that plantation?
John Hazel's face became so grim that it terrified the
boy.
</p>

<p>
"Gie me my whustle back, man, an' let me gang awa' hame,
noo!  Ye'll no tak it fra' me?" he stuttered, blinking back
the tears.
</p>

<p>
"I must take it from you, for I know the man who lost it.
But I'll give you half-a-crown instead, to buy another," said
John....  "You'll like the new one awfully!" ... John
added as the coin changed owners.  "And I'll give you another
sixpence for sweeties if you'll tell me what else you found in
the wood."
</p>

<p>
"Naething at a' but a bit o' broon cloth&mdash;soger's cloth like
yon&mdash;"  A stubby finger pointed at John's sleeve&mdash;"stickin'
oot o' a tod's howe, an' the bit white string near by."
</p>

<p>
"You mean the lanyard.  Well, then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Eh, then I pu'ed the wee bit string an' the siller whustle
cam' oot wi't, an' sae I took the whustle an' ran awa' to
pley.  An' when I saw ye comin' I thocht ye were the Man.
Noo gie me the bawbee!"
</p>

<p>
"You mean the sixpence!  Tell me about the Man you
mean,&mdash;and earn a shilling instead."
</p>

<p>
"Ay!  The Man was dressed like yoursel is&mdash;but grand,
like an officer, wi' gowd on his bonnet an' sleeves, an' mair
ribbons on his breast.  No the day's day, but back in the
week, I'm thinkin' it was Monunday!&mdash;I seen him comin' doon
the road, an' he fleyt me wi' his een."
</p>

<p>
"He scared you with his eyes?  What did you do then?"
</p>

<p>
"I bude to rin awa' at first, because 'twas gettin' fell
mirk-like.  An' sair I wantit my tea and lardy-piece.  But I didna'
rin ower far.  I muntit the fence an' keeked roun' a buss,
an' saw him loup in ower.  An' he gaed intil the woodie, an'
cam' oot nae mair!"
</p>

<p>
Come By Chance pointed with a chilblained hand to the
stile of the plantation, and brought the hand deftly back to
show its empty palm.  The shilling having followed the
half-crown into a pocket of the cut-down corduroys:
</p>

<p>
"Hae ye anither?" the recipient demanded avidly.
</p>

<p>
"No, but I might give twopence more to hear how the Man
came out."
</p>

<p>
"He didna!"
</p>

<p>
A shadow seemed to fall on the brightness of the snow,
and the wind's bite grew keener.  John Hazel echoed:
</p>

<p>
"Didn't come out?  Are you quite sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, yea! for though I hing aboot to see, he showed nae
bone nor feather.  An' at lang last&mdash;when I'se fell hungert for
my piece&mdash;an' fain to rin hame to my mither&mdash;anither man
louped oot intil the road, an' cam' alang by."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know it wasn't the Man?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he was no' braw like the ither!  He had nae
gowd on his bonnet, an' his claithes were hamely like my
daddie's,&mdash;or they wad be, gin my mither wad own that my
daddie was Keeper Todd."
</p>

<p>
John Hazel suddenly knew that the chill shadow had passed,
and that the sun was shining.  And he tossed another shilling to
Come By Chance, saying:
</p>

<p>
"There's another bob for you, you queer little rascal.  Cut
before I change my mind and want the money back!"
</p>

<p>
And as the tow-headed took to his chilblained heels, revealing
in his hurried flight that his shirt-tail hung out through a
ragged hole at the back of his corduroys, John Hazel jumping
the hog-backed stile, dived into the plantation.  Something told
him that he would come out much wiser than he went in.

<h3>
XXVI
</h3>

<p>
The dull tramp of heavy Service boots, following the maid
who was that day John Hazel's guide, over the carpeted stone
flags of the corridor to the little panelled morning parlour,
brought an unexpected, welcome sense of relief to Katharine's
overstrained nerves.  The door opened, and she moved swiftly
to him&mdash;stopping him with both hands held out, when he would
have made his strange, half-Eastern salutation&mdash;saying in her
full, womanly tones:
</p>

<p>
"How can I thank you, Mr. Hazel?"
</p>

<p>
He answered, tritely and clumsily, but with very evident
sincerity:
</p>

<p>
"By showing me straight off the reel, how I can be of use
to you."
</p>

<p>
Some aching spot in her sore heart was touched by his
genuine eagerness to serve her.  For a moment she could not
speak....  So they stood, her fine white hand engulfed by
Hazel's great brown one, his strong black eyes, unrebuked,
dwelling on his lady's face.
</p>

<p>
She looked older, with wide purplish shadows round about
her beautiful eyes, and their clear golden-amber changed to
sorrowful rust-colour.  The clear cream and carnation of her
skin was dulled to a pale olive....  The rich brown hair upon
her temples, and above her brow, showed here and there a
thread of silver.  She began, speaking with a curious, hurried
breathlessness:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hazel, I know you must have seen newspaper accounts
of the inexplicable disappearance of&mdash;a friend who&mdash;I
have no need to hide the fact!&mdash;is very, very dear to me....
You must know that I speak of Colonel Yaill.  You saw him
here the Saturday you came here first, and later at my father's
funeral.  You&mdash;<i>Ah&mdash;!</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were on John Hazel's when the memory leaped
into them.  They dilated, blazed with tawny fire....  John
thought of a lioness....  She snatched her hand instantly
away from his, crying:
</p>

<p>
"What am I thinking of?  Why,&mdash;it was you who threatened
him!&mdash;he told me so himself!  You said you would save him
the trouble if he did not tell me of his marriage.  How could
I have forgotten?  Is my memory failing me?  And you....
How could you have come by the knowledge with which you
menaced him? ... In Hospital? ... No!  Where and how,
then?  The whole thing is a horrible mystery to me! ..."
</p>

<p>
John Hazel told her, in a few bluntly-spoken sentences, just
how the story of Yaill's marriage had been given him.  She
heard him to the end of it, and said, with the ghost of a smile:
</p>

<p>
"So you entered upon your hereditary office of champion,
straightway.  And Lady Wastwood got the story from her
Headquarters&mdash;I understand the whole thing clearly!  She is a
dear, and I love her, but a terror of a talker....  The whole
county must have rung with scandal, ages before I dreamed
that anybody knew...."  She shuddered.  "Oh, me! what
things they must have said about Edward!&mdash;must be saying
about him at this moment when he&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her voice broke in a sob, and her full heart brimmed over.
John Hazel said roughly, for he could not bear to see her tears:
</p>

<p>
"They may talk, but there's one thing nobody on earth&mdash;or
elsewhere!&mdash;will ever be able to say of him.  That he isn't
a thundering brave man!"
</p>

<p>
The sudden, fierce carnation that had flooded the wide oval
of her face a moment before, had given place to the olive
paleness.  Now a faint tinge of the banished red came creeping
back again.
</p>

<p>
"You threatened Edward Yaill&mdash;yet you defend him?"
</p>

<p>
John Hazel answered simply enough:
</p>

<p>
"I had to see that you were undeceived.  You were, first
of all, my business.  But knowing what shell-shock means&mdash;as
men have learned to know the hellish thing in this damned
War&mdash;how, in common justice, can I condemn Colonel
Yaill?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you!  Oh, thank you!  That does my heart good!"
</p>

<p>
The wide, sweet smile curved Katharine's mouth again, and
her dimmed eyes found a sparkle to cheer their sombre
rust-colour.  She went on:
</p>

<p>
"To know that somebody besides myself pities him&mdash;you
don't know&mdash;you can't know, what it means to me!  For no
one will have a kind thing to say for Edward.  Beyond the
newspaper flummery and flapdoodle, there won't be a word,
nor a thought, that isn't&mdash;merciless to him! ..."
</p>

<p>
She was sitting now in her hearthside chair and John was
standing on the other side of the fireplace.  The antique
mirror above the little Tudor clock, that had reflected Yaill's
thin, handsome face and haunted grey eyes, gave back an
image of the huge black head, the portentous hooked nose, and
swarthy countenance of this new and strangely dominating
force that had moved across the threshold of Kerr's Arbour,
out of the veiled, mysterious Past, but a few days previously.
His elbow rested on the mantelshelf, where the other man had
leaned his: he clenched his great hand as he answered Katharine:
</p>

<p>
"'Merciless.' ... And why on this rotten little planet should
people be merciless to the man?"
</p>

<p>
"Because"&mdash;she frowned and looked at John from between
her narrowed eyelids&mdash;"because of the odd, clandestine fashion
in which&mdash;after his strange marriage&mdash;Colonel Yaill has gone
away....  I am not brilliant, it may be, nor very highly
cultured.  But I know, and very thoroughly&mdash;the world to which
we belong.  I speak, be it understood, of his world and
mine."  John felt himself an alien.  "The world we choose to call
Society.  And Society will never pardon nor condone, nor
exonerate this act of Colonel Yaill's."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think the pardon of Society particularly worth
having?  Do you think the good opinion of a Society as
fat-headed, as thick-witted and as narrow-minded as you represent
it&mdash;matters a tin of ration apple-jam? ... Now listen, Miss
Forbis!  If you think me rude, an offensive brute, say to
yourself, 'This man can't help it!  He isn't in Society&mdash;but he is
out to work for me!  The wag of a finger of my hand would
bring him from the ends of the world to serve or fight for
me!'  Please don't interrupt, for time is time&mdash;and I have
more to say&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He drew a big breath that hurt his wounded lung, and
went on speaking:
</p>

<p>
"When you sent for me, I believed you thought that Colonel
Yaill had put an end to himself.  When I saw you I knew
you had never for a minute entertained the idea&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke in now:
</p>

<p>
"Never!  The suggestion of suicide has been spread by
people who know nothing of the man they slander.  In
absolute confidence I will tell you now&mdash;for how could you be
of any help to me unless I absolutely trust you!&mdash;Edward Yaill
has gone to the East to find my lost Julian&mdash;my dear brother,
whom I have since heard was killed on August 21st&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
John Hazel's black eyes flashed.  He broke in:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Forbis, something of that sort is what I have
suspected."
</p>

<p>
"Wait," she said.  "<i>He</i> told me that he would not return
to&mdash;to his wife&mdash;upon the old footing....  She had cruelly
tricked and deceived him&mdash;he could not, once he knew the
truth&mdash;endure to live with her! ... So he made up his mind to go
secretly away.  He might have applied to the War Office&mdash;he
has powerful friends at Whitehall&mdash;for a transfer to the
Eastern Front.  Why didn't he?  That's one of the things I
can't understand! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know? ..."
</p>

<p>
John's big voice boomed out, drowning the little silvery
chime of the Tudor timepiece.
</p>

<p>
"When questions like that crop up, the answer is,
shell-shock.  A man who is possessed of ordinary, healthy nerves,
will act in an ordinary way.  But the man who's been subject
to the devilries of High Explosive, will pop up queer
byways in his impatience of circumlocution&mdash;adopt unexpected
measures; reach his objective by methods as destructively
simple as&mdash;the rat's way of getting into a cheese.  He
<i>might</i>&mdash;supposin' he'd been a normal man&mdash;have engineered the thing
at Whitehall.  Being shell-shocked, he simply burns his boats
and swims."
</p>

<p>
Katharine begged:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on!  You're helping me!&mdash;you're helping me wonderfully.
Things that seemed crazy&mdash;out of the comprehensible&mdash;are
beginning to arrange themselves....  Now there's
another point.  You saw, perhaps, a newspaper reference to
Sir Arthur Ely?  Well, it has occurred to me as possible that
Edward confided his plans to Sir Arthur&mdash;that impenetrable
sarcophagus of Society secrets.  You may have noticed that
Sir Arthur's reply to Press inquiries showed a&mdash;a considerable
degree of reserve?"
</p>

<p>
John had noticed it.  He admired Katharine's cool, clear,
masterful way of assembling her evidence, and making her
points tellingly, each in its turn.  He kept back his own solid
piece of conviction until she finished&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He has gone, I am convinced that I know where&mdash;though I
can't make out how he managed going....  But one thing is
clear.  I must get word to him! ... He has gone to find
Julian, whom he loved!&mdash;my Julian, who was killed by a
Turkish shell, in the storming of Scimitar Hill on August 21st.
That is where you come in!&mdash;that is where you can help me.
In getting the news through to Colonel Yaill in case he does
not know! ..."
</p>

<p>
John thought a moment and said:
</p>

<p>
"We might&mdash;in case he has gone out to the East believing
your brother to be living&mdash;get the news to him <i>per</i> advertisement
in sundry foreign rags.  Personals, discreetly worded,
might do the trick&mdash;inserted in French and British papers,
published in the Levant,&mdash;in Egypt,&mdash;and at Salonika, and in
such others as are printed and disseminated by the Germans
in the Near East."
</p>

<p>
She caught her breath.
</p>

<p>
"Can you manage that last stroke? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I'll not swear I can, but there's a chance I may engineer
it.  Write out the ads. and let me have them at once!  In
English, French and German.  Worded so that he'll
understand....  Some ought to be in Turkish,&mdash;and others in
Arabic, and some in Egyptian Arabic.  For&mdash;your man's a bit
of a linguist, unless I judge him wrong!"
</p>

<p>
Katharine's eyes brightened with pride in her man as she
answered:
</p>

<p>
"He speaks most of the languages of the Orient, and Nearer
East."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  Now, are you quite sure your brother has been
killed?"  He went on, meeting her startled look....  "Because
the War Office isn't infallible....  A pal of mine&mdash;reported
dead over eleven months ago&mdash;has spent about three
in trying to convince the authorities that he's very much alive!
Last week he heard from them, asking him to reconsider the
matter! and send in another detailed statement; and now that
he's convinced 'em of his existence&mdash;they've docked his pay
for the eleven months he's been officially dead! ... And I
know another man, a virtuous unmarried one-pipper,&mdash;who
gets paid an allowance, monthly, for a missus and three kids....
They don't exist&mdash;and never did, but the Pay Department
says they do,&mdash;and returns him the money when he tries to pay
it back!  One day they'll say he's robbed 'em&mdash;and call a Court
Martial&mdash;but till then he spends the cash in cigars, and other
forms of crime.  Not as applicable as the first illustration, but
still a case in point."  He grinned....  "And hasn't it struck
you, that Colonel Yaill, knowing the dudheads at Whitehall&mdash;would
be likely to go on looking for Father Forbis as long
as a chance remained?  Now, what about those ads. you were
going to write for me?  I'm quite certain they ought to go
in....  But mind you make it clear to Colonel Yaill that
you've no private, first-hand information....  Put it '<i>Julian
reported killed</i>' and then he'll understand!"
</p>

<p>
She levelled her fine brows and thought a moment, then
rose from her chair, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Would this do?  '<i>Edward ... Julian reported killed
Gallipoli, August 21st.  Seek no further</i>' or '<i>Search useless.  Send
address for communication.  K.</i>"  Then as he nodded his
approval, "Very well, I'll write the advertisements at once," she
said.  "Of course I don't know any Arabic, and my Italian is
simply rocky&mdash;it always sent Father into fits of laughter....
But my German is passable, and my French is&mdash;quite decent....
I was educated at the <i>Sacré Cœur</i> Convent, Chalkcliff&mdash;where
most of the nuns are Parisian ladies....  Smoke if you
care to, while I'm writing....  And do find yourself a
comfortable chair...."
</p>

<p>
She crossed the room to a well-used escritoire, inlaid ebony
of Indian workmanship, glancing back to smile at John Hazel
as she drew up her writing-chair.  Her Persian cat leaped
purring on her shoulder, and she rubbed her cheek against
his warm silver-grey coat, giving the caress craved by his
cattish little soul, before she gently set him down....  Then
she began to write, and John sat watching her, revelling in her
vigorous, healthful uprightness, and the grace with which her
long limbs disposed themselves in the seated pose....
</p>

<p>
"Don't rush it....  Take your time!" ... He was speaking
from behind her.  "I'll see that the others are cautiously
worded....  A man in disguise as an Arab or a Turk might
betray himself unconsciously, if his eye happened to drop on a
line that was meant for him, you know."
</p>

<p>
"'A man in disguise.' ..."  She caught her breath.  "Oh!&mdash;you
are wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
"Not even my mother ever thought that," said Hazel, with
his gleaming grin.  "But I'm ready to put money on my
theory that the Colonel&mdash;to get out of England in the quietest
way possible&mdash;has enlisted in some unit of the Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force."
</p>

<p>
"As a common soldier&mdash;an ordinary Tommy! ... You
think so meanly of him? ..."
</p>

<p>
For a moment her broad front of displeasure was turned
upon John Hazel.  Then the anger died out of her as he said
quietly:
</p>

<p>
"I've learned to think a lot of ordinary Tommies, since
I've been in this beastly War.  And I stick to my
opinion&mdash;for a reason!"
</p>

<p>
He got up.  His big hand had been in his bulging tunic-pocket.
He pulled out a Brass Hat, ignominiously squashed,
and with the peak broken&mdash;and said as he offered it to Katharine:
</p>

<p>
"Here's my reason!  Good enough, I think!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried, "where did you get that? ... It is
Edward's!" ... And snatched it almost fiercely, and crushed it
against her breast....
</p>

<p>
"This too!" ... John thrust on her the silver whistle....
"A child was playing with it near the plantation below your
Private Road....  That put me on the scent....  I annexed
the whistle&mdash;here it is for you!&mdash;you'll see his name is on
it!&mdash;and went in and poked about....  To discover the complete
uniform of a British C.O., Field jacket, badges, Bedford cords,
and the whole posh kit, wrapped up in a trencher, strapped
with a Sam Browne, and stuffed into a fox's hole.  Presently
when it's dark enough, I'll lug the rest of the kit up to
you....  Now, do you think I've grounds for my belief? ..."
</p>

<p>
Katharine was trembling.
</p>

<p>
"You frighten me!" she said to him.  "The police and their
helpers have searched and found nothing....  You come&mdash;and
these hidden things are uncovered at your feet....  What
does it mean?  Do you believe that you and I have lived on
earth before now? ... Are we taking up old threads that were
broken ages ago? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Not for a second do I believe that!" answered John Hazel.
"But that we are influenced and guided by others who have
walked this earth before us,&mdash;yes!&mdash;I certainly think we are!
While they were about it they might have shown me where
the Colonel got the suit of civvies he changed into when he
gave his swank rags to Brother Fox for keeps.  Plain clothes!"
... He answered Katharine's inquiring look as though she
had spoken.  "And pretty well worn....  Don't stop to ask
me how I know!" ...
</p>

<p>
"'Plain clothes'! ... A shabby shooting-suit...." Katharine
repeated.  "Wait one minute&mdash;I must look! ..."
</p>

<p>
And she was gone....  The sixty seconds were barely
ticked off by the gilded arrow of the Tudor timepiece before
the door opened to admit her, minus the finds of the
plantation,&mdash;panting a little, with flushed cheeks and radiant eyes of
joy....
</p>

<p>
"I have been to his room," she told John Hazel, breathlessly.
"There is a camphor-wood press there where&mdash;since
August, 1914,&mdash;I have kept the suit Edward was wearing
when the War call came to him.  Rough grey homespun&mdash;with
a Norfolk jacket.  And the things have gone out of the
press.  He must have taken them&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm dead sure he took them!  Now another question crops
up, Miss Forbis.  In these days of Compulsory Service&mdash;though
the Act's not a fortnight old&mdash;how's an able-bodied
man in plain clothes to avoid being captured by the
Government's Fine Tooth Comb?  Tapped on the shoulder by a
Recruiting Officer or a policeman&mdash;and challenged to cough up
his Conscription papers, or produce his Exemption Sheet?
What would the Colonel's age be?  Anything over the Limit?"
</p>

<p>
The coarseness of his tone offended delicacy....  Her
brows contracted as she answered with chilly dignity:
</p>

<p>
"He was thirty-nine in May.  (<i>Thirty-nine.  And he might
have married me when he was thirty-one!</i>)" her heart cried
rebelliously.  What had Edward thought to gain by those
continued delays?  She had been at her loveliest, she knew, when
they had first loved each other....  Twenty-three&mdash;and
between twenty-three and thirty-one&mdash;eight worse than wasted
years!
</p>

<p>
Years lost&mdash;foregone&mdash;wilfully forfeited....  Her heart
wailed like a plover over its rifled nest....  And yet not
lost....  Five of them at least had been glorious with happiness.
There had been rare glimpses of sweetness even in these last
three years of War....
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me!" she said, wakened from sad memories by
John Hazel's taking leave of her.  "I was thinking....  I did
not hear you....  Must you absolutely go?"
</p>

<p>
"I must not stay, Miss Forbis.  The other things that are
hidden in the plantation I shall leave you to find for yourself.
The fox-hole is at the bottom of the bank facing south
beside a big stone&mdash;you can hardly miss it!  You will hear
from me, when there is anything you should know&mdash;until there
is, good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
She said, with her characteristic, cordial imperiousness:
"Good-bye comes after luncheon! ... You must not leave this
house again without breaking bread! ..."
</p>

<p>
He yielded, and soon they were seated at a long, well-covered
table in a room whose sombre panelling was relieved by
inset portraits of dead-and-gone Forbises, glittering trophies of
Indian weapons, horns and heads of big game; some fine
pieces of Oriental porcelain and a noble buffet of silver plate.
That sense of strangeness still remained.  Strongly as the
good things of the palate appealed to John Hazel's sensuous
nature, he found himself swallowing hot savoury Scotch
broth&mdash;demolishing cold game-pie and salad with the barest
appreciation of their excellence&mdash;and gulping down the
Chateau Margaux of the Kerr's Arbour cellars, as indifferently
as though it had been the beer of the canteen....
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Mr. Hazel," Katharine said at parting, "and
God bless you!  I shall never forget what you have done.
Should I hear from Colonel Yaill, I shall communicate to the
address you have given me.  Should you hear of him&mdash;you will
write to me here at Kerr's."
</p>

<p>
She gave him both her white hands, returning his big strong
grasp with warm, sisterly friendliness, sending a strange and
wonderful thrill through the giant frame of the man.
</p>

<p>
"May I&mdash;" he asked, almost humbly, with his black eyes
entreating hers, in the way that a woman who has been wooed
can never misunderstand....
</p>

<p>
"If you wish!" she answered, cordially, and he stooped and
touched with his fleshy lips the beautiful hands he held.  Then
he released them....  He was at the door, looking back at
Katharine....  As he turned the handle she spoke impulsively:
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?&mdash;you haven't yet told me!"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose because I thought you would guess," John Hazel
returned.  "The fact is, I got orders yesterday to join my
old crowd&mdash;the 'Fenchurch Streets'&mdash;at Salonika.  So I'm
going out to the Near East&mdash;to look for your friend!"
</p>

<p>
"Not to fight?" Katharine asked, smiling, though touched
by his rugged simplicity.
</p>

<p>
He answered:
</p>

<p>
"To do that, and the other job too...."
</p>

<p>
"It is almost certain that I, myself, shall be going out to
Egypt shortly," she told him, "to work at the Hospital of
Montana near Alexandria&mdash;with my friends of the Red Cross."
</p>

<p>
He nodded gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Good luck to you and them!  There's a thing I'd like to
hear you say, Miss Forbis.  Do you mind just telling me to
carry on?"
</p>

<p>
"Carry on, John Hazel!" said Katharine royally.
</p>

<p>
He waved a hand to her, and was gone.  And the great
lonely, empty House of Kerr's Arbour was tenfold emptier
and lonelier without that vital, powerful embodiment of faith
and loyalty....

<i>Book the Third:</i> THE FINDING
</h2>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
Weeks after John Hazel had sailed with a draft of
leave-expired "Fenchurch Streets,"&mdash;to join the Division
to which that gallant London regiment was attached&mdash;with
the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Forces at
Salonika&mdash;and while brave British men in Palestine were
cracking their teeth on that hard nut of Gaza&mdash;H.M. Transport
<i>Loyalty</i>, (an ex-Austrian Lloyd Liner captured at the beginning
of the War, and converted into a Mediterranean Hospital
ship), sailed for Egypt,&mdash;and in the <i>Photographic Puff</i> of the
week's issue appeared&mdash;under an enlarged snapshot of the
pre-War departure of the ex-Austrian Lloyd from Southampton
Docks&mdash;this announcement:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "POPULAR SOCIETY PEERESS, COMMANDANT OF L.L.W.S.L.,<br>
  SAILS FOR EASTERN THEATRE OF WAR."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another periodical of the type that daily caters for readers
of another order, published, under a portrait of Lady
Wastwood in exiguous dinner dress:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "TRIXIE MAKES TRACKS FOR EGYPT TO FIND OUT WHY<br>
  SPHINX SMILES."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
While in the <i>Daily Wire</i> of a few days' later issue was
published a brief paragraph to the effect that H.M. Transport
<i>Loyalty</i> had been torpedoed on the fifth day of her voyage
out to Alexandria; carrying some officers and men of the
Egyptian Expeditionary Force returning from sick-leave; a
detachment of Military Nurses and fourteen brand-new
ambulance-cars; many War Hospital stores and comforts destined
for our wounded, together with a complete unit of the British
Red Cross.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Forbis, V.A.D., of Kerr's Arbour, N.B., is included
in the list of the rescued, as also Trixie, Lady Wastwood,
O.B.E., Commandant L.L.W.S.L., who was on her way to the
East to employ her well-known powers of organisation in the
establishment of a Hostel for Convalescent Officers
(Auxiliary) in the neighbourhood of Alexandria."  The famous
motto of the Legion is, doubtless, familiar to our readers: "Do
Anything, Go Anywhere, Stick At Nothing, and Never
Grouse."
</p>

<p>
The usual boat-drill had not been neglected, and when the
alarm had once been sounded, everybody had dutifully turned
up at his or her allotted station in overcoat and cork lifebelt,
to be not at all astonished by the intelligence that the scare
was simply a dud....  No attack upon the part of enemy
submarines had been anticipated....  The <i>Loyalty</i>, with her three
vast squares of green paint bounding a white-edged Red Cross
(outlined at night by brilliant electric lights)&mdash;amidships on
each side, ought to be regarded as sacrosanct by German
submarines....  But of course people understood there were
loose mines in the Mediterranean, though the minefields were
all known.
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood had rather ruffled the good-humour of the
Captain by constantly asking him how he could be Certain of
this?  But after he had personally conducted the Commandant,
life-belt and all&mdash;for from this practical insurance Trixie never
separated&mdash;to his chart-house on the Lower Bridge, and
displayed before her green eyes a chart of the Mediterranean,
ornamented with designs in coloured inks by the Navigating;
Lieutenant&mdash;indicating areas strewn with floating mines by the
Kaiser and the Sublime Porte, "G.M. at such-and-such a depth,
and T.M. at such-and-such another," and illustrated the uses
of the telephones between the Wireless Room and the chart-house,
and the telegraphs linking the officer on the bridge
with the engine-room, and the speaking-tubes communicating
with the batteries of quick-firing guns fore and aft,&mdash;Trixie's
anxieties were completely laid to rest.  She thanked the
Captain effusively, and with a gracious smile and bow to the
Navigating Lieutenant, descended to the saloon-deck
cabin,&mdash;which she shared with Miss Forbis&mdash;to renew her complexion
for the 12.30 lunch.
</p>

<p>
To wash your hands, arrange your hair and refresh your
complexion while arrayed in a life-belt being impossible, Trixie
removed her practical insurance, hanging it on the cabin
sofa-end while she monopolised the looking-glass.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am a grouse&mdash;and a disgrace to the Legion,
I know it too well!" she owned to Katharine, as she intensified
her V-shaped Pierrot smile with a stick of scarlet paste,
"and instead of playing rounders and quoits and clock-golf&mdash;which
is exactly the same kind of thing as playing water
polo in a wash-hand basin&mdash;what I really long to do is to
huddle in a deck-chair, and look out for oily streaks and white
breaks in the water.  But I am the victim of a morbid
imagination&mdash;that keeps telling me what happens to you when you get
wrecked at sea.  You go down and come up three times&mdash;and
see all the events of your past life processioning before
you.  That must be horrible!  And they say it always
happens&mdash;the people, I mean, who have nearly been drowned&mdash;and
were only just saved in time!"
</p>

<p>
"But nobody who has been quite drowned has ever given an
account of it," said Katharine, with her wholesome,
heartening laugh.
</p>

<p>
Sea and sunshine had done much for Miss Forbis.  Private
Abrahams would have recognised her for the bright-eyed,
smiling woman he had met that day on the Menin Road....
We cannot always mourn the dead, or bewail the lost that are
living; though often her heart cried out in anguish for her
dear ones; and waking of nights upon the shallow pillow of
the upper bunk in the suffocating cabin, she would feel for a
silver whistle she carried in her bosom&mdash;and kiss it&mdash;and cry
herself to sleep again....  Or lie sleepless amidst the
creakings, the overhead tramplings and shoutings; the snorting of
electrically-driven ventilators; the occasional thump! of a
bigger sea than usual upon the bows of the <i>Loyalty</i>, and the
dismal sounds emitted by sufferers from the malady of the
sea....
</p>

<p>
"How sensibly you look at things, Kathy dear," said Lady
Wastwood, putting the final touch to her Pierrot smile....
</p>

<p>
Friendly and even affectionate as were the relations between
these two women,&mdash;no reference had ever been made by one or
the other to that February day of Trixie's encounter with
Edward Yaill on board the Scotch Express.  But the subject
was in the air, and both felt it,&mdash;and possibly because of this,
their conversation was elaborately casual....
</p>

<p>
Trixie added, as she intensified the eyebrows that resembled
musical slurs, with a black pencil: "But really, my stupid
nerves are quieting down!  The skipper has cheered me
wonderfully.  There's something so refreshingly bluff and
reassuring about a big smiling sailor man with white ducks
and an Irish accent,&mdash;of the northern kind that one doesn't
associate with dynamite and revolvers and masks.  He has
quite put my idiotic fears to bed.  I shall never&mdash;AH!"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
A hot, violet-yellow light seemed to fill the cabin, as the
terrible detonation shook the <i>Loyalty</i>.  The air seemed flame....
Dust filled their lungs and nostrils, and the shattering crash
of descending tons of water, mingled with the great cry
blended of innumerable voices, that goes up to Heaven from
a mined or torpedoed ship....  Then the shrieks and cries
ceased, as Discipline asserted itself.  Through the deafening
roar of escaping steam&mdash;and the racket of shattered engines&mdash;the
bugle sounded the alarm&mdash;in deadly earnest now....
</p>

<p>
"Come!" said Katharine Forbis.  She wrenched open the
cabin door, letting in a rush of water, seized both their
life-belts and gripped hold of Lady Wastwood, who, half-swooning,
wavered as though about to fall.  Somehow Miss Forbis
dragged her charge through a jam of white-faced men and
women&mdash;along the broad gangway, oddly tilted forwards&mdash;ankle-deep
in water&mdash;up the main companion&mdash;tilted too, at
that queer forward angle&mdash;down which the sea was rushing
in a heavy waterfall.  Drenched and gasping, to reach the
promenade-deck&mdash;emerging into the radiant beauty of a
Mediterranean day with the shout:
</p>

<p>
"All passengers on deck with life-belts on!  All passengers
on deck with life-belts on!" ringing in her ears....
</p>

<p>
Sun and sea, sea and sun,&mdash;and Death at its ugliest&mdash;an
uncanny combination....  There was no panic after the first
outcry and the headlong scrimmage for the upper deck.  The
deafening boom of escaping steam made it necessary to shout
so as to be heard by those who stood nearest....  The forward
tilt of the smooth white planks increased momentarily.  The
<i>Loyalty's</i> bow-plates and forward compartments had been
stove in by the explosion.  She was settling down by the nose,
into the mirror-clear water&mdash;while the Military Nurses in their
grey cloaks,, and the men and women of the Red Cross stood
to attention on her tilting decks&mdash;and her officers went to and
fro....
</p>

<p>
There never had been panic, there was even a little
laughter....  No fear of horrors of thirst and starvation attending
on shipwreck in the crowded Mediterranean Sea....  The
low grey hulls of the <i>Loyalty's</i> two attendant Destroyers were
visible on her starboard a long way ahead....  They were
getting steam up....  "Coming to look after us!" shouted
somebody to somebody.  Of course they had been apprised by
Wireless of what had occurred....
</p>

<p>
"Great invention, Wireless!" shouted somebody else to Katharine....
</p>

<p>
Katharine nodded back.  She hardly felt depressed.
</p>

<p>
"<i>B'mm.  Hm'm!  Oom'm m! ...</i>"
</p>

<p>
A seaplane came droning out of the bright distance from
where the low grey hulls of Destroyers showed, shepherding
a stately procession of camouflaged troopers and battleships,&mdash;and
hovered in narrowing circles over the <i>Loyalty</i>.  Her
pilot shut off&mdash;and his observer shouted something through
a megaphone.  What he said could not be heard through the
roar of the escaping steam.  Then he dropped a weighted note
and flew away southwards, and the Second Officer grabbed the
note and hurried off to take it to the Captain on the bridge....
Katharine never saw him again....  But inside the space of
twenty seconds every soul on board the doomed vessel was
in possession of the ugly fact....
</p>

<p>
The <i>Loyalty</i> had got out of her course,&mdash;strayed miles from
the guarded ocean highway, traversed in comparative safety
by the shipping of the Allies, patrolled by British Fleet
hydroplanes, submarines and Argus-eyed T.B.D.'s....  She was in
the middle of a Turkish minefield, one of those fulminating
enemy areas marked out on her charts with lines and letters in
coloured inks, that had been displayed by her Captain to the
anxious eyes of Lady Wastwood.  The powerful magnetos
of a German submarine,&mdash;hovering in her near vicinity, had
caused deviation in the British transport's compasses.  Or,
there had been a blunder&mdash;the truth will never be known....
</p>

<p>
Of the boats that had got away from the ship,&mdash;the first were
crowded with women only; the next were packed with women
and a sprinkling of men....  They pulled away towards those
grey shapes on the southern horizon&mdash;topped by columns of
slanting smoke&mdash;and presently were mere specks upon the
straining sight....
</p>

<p>
As Katharine and Lady Wastwood were helped over the
rail into their boat, and it was lowered to the level of the
water&mdash;something like a shudder went through the <i>Loyalty</i>....
Her stern-ports lifted at a greater angle, and her bows were
submerged more deeply.  Looking up at her huge grey bulk,
it seemed to Katharine that some vast cetacean,&mdash;bombed and
harpooned&mdash;lay dying in agony upon the smooth and glassy
sea....
</p>

<p>
She saw the Captain on the bridge, binoculars in hand,
speaking to one of the minor officers.  Urged in some way, he
shook his head as though in refusal, and as his subordinate
quitted the bridge&mdash;resumed his interrupted scanning of the
distant sea.  Perhaps the binoculars had focussed the travelling
top of a periscope, and the breaking of white water, miles
away to the east....
</p>

<p>
When the double White Death Streak cleaved the blue sea,
and one after another two torpedoes hit the <i>Loyalty</i> on her
port side amidships&mdash;her bows plunged downwards, throwing
most of the people remaining on her decks, into the water.
Others clung to her rails and the roofs of her deck-structures,
as with a thunderous rattle of scrapping iron, her bowels fell
out of her mangled body,&mdash;and she dived and vanished in a
whirlpool of her own.  As her stern heaved up perpendicularly,
lifting her huge triple screws sheer out of the swirling
water, a Portuguese sailor scrambled up upon her counter,
naked as in the hour of his birth,&mdash;and so stood poised; his
rich brown body gleaming,&mdash;his wild eyes and bared teeth
glittering in the sun:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mao riao parta o' diabo!</i> ... (May the Thunderbolt split
you, devil! ...")
</p>

<p>
He shook his dark clenched fist towards the east, shrieking
out the imprecation&mdash;meant perhaps for the Kaiser or the
Sultan or the Commander of the submarine,&mdash;and dived
magnificently as the ship sank, dragging down with her the last
boats....
</p>

<p>
And then, through suffocation, and roaring sounds of water
in her ears&mdash;flashes of sunlight piercing her smarting eyes,
wedges of blackness driving over mind and soul&mdash;lightning
flashes of consciousness&mdash;gasped-out prayers to God, wild cries
for help,&mdash;washed down her choking throat by volumes of
bitter waters&mdash;Katharine Forbis came up out of the depths&mdash;to
find herself floating in sunlight and strange silence, on a sea
covered with a strange confusion of floating <i>débris</i>....
</p>

<p>
Not alone, for all the silence.  In the company of a good
many other people, pluckily bent on keeping their courage up,
and other folks' as well.  Military nurses and Red Cross
V.A.D's, orderlies, officers, sailors, Tommies....  Some of the
men on duty forward had been horribly injured by the
explosion of the Turkish contact-mine.  What could be done for
them had been done before quitting the sinking <i>Loyalty</i>.  But
as the blood from their cruel wounds drained away into the
waste of water....  It was not the first time that Katharine
Forbis had seen brave men die....  Then a V.A.D. woman
perched with two others on a gangway, called to her across
a patch of water&mdash;a lagoon ringed-in with floating wreckage:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do look at the Commandant!&mdash;I am afraid she is dying!"
</p>

<p>
Treading water, paddling with a wooden fruit-dish, horribly
hampered by her cork panoply,&mdash;Katharine crossed the patch
of sea.  The thin bluish wedge of Trixie's face lay tilted
upwards to the jeering sunshine, against the slab of cork
outcropping at the back of her belt.  Her green eyes, half-open,
looked hard and glassy as enamel&mdash;the livid lips were parted,
showing the set white teeth....
</p>

<p>
"Oh try to live!" begged Katharine.  "See&mdash;there are ships
in the distance!"  She pointed to some grey shapes moving
on the southern horizon under their slanting columns of grey
smoke.  "The boats that have left us will be picked up&mdash;they
will be sent back for us! ..."
</p>

<p>
"No ship commanded by a sane man will stick her nose into
the middle of a charted Turkish minefield!" came from a
man who hung on to a deck-seat and a wooden hen-coop next
them, and had overheard.  "When the contact stove in our
forward plates I sent out the S.O.S. and got through to
the Commander of one of those Destroyers...."  He jerked
his chin angrily towards some slanting streaks of smoke to
the southward.  "All he could do was to send that hydro
from the nearest Battle Cruiser to have a look at us; explain
what kind of a mess we were in&mdash;in case we hadn't guessed
it already!&mdash;and tell us to wait for the boats! ..."
</p>

<p>
And the speaker, who had been the Wireless Operator on
board the <i>Loyalty</i>, whose head was swathed in a bloody towel
and whose right arm hung broken by his side,&mdash;grinned a forlorn
grin, and tightened with his teeth the buckle of the leather
waist-strap that supported him on his improvised raft, as
Trixie's head fell limply back, and a faint moan fluttered
from her lips, that were getting ashen grey....
</p>

<p>
"Please, please, don't give up!" said Katharine, mustering
all her forces.  She splashed water on the grey, peaked face
and shook the thin shoulder.  "Listen to me....  Do you
hear?  Don't you <i>dare</i> to die! ..."
</p>

<p>
But not Katharine's utmost efforts could have kept the
dwindling life in Trixie, as the hours dragged on, and the
blazing sun beat on their misery....  But that her good
Angel, or Trixie's, reminded her that the little courier-bag
slung about her shoulders, containing her money and papers,
accommodated a tiny brandy-flask.
</p>

<p>
A sickness of sheer despair came over her as she realised
that, environed by the unwieldy cork slabs of her life-belt, she
could not possibly get at the bag....  Then she remembered,
when there had been a moment or two of delay in readying
the ship's boat&mdash;she had taken the flask out of the bag, and
thrust it in the breast-pocket of her serge jacket.  With a
rush of thankfulness she felt for it, and found it there still.
</p>

<p>
It seemed long to Katharine before she could unscrew the
flask-cap, and force a few drops of Cognac between the other's
tightly-clenched teeth.  When Trixie sighed, and opened her
green eyes,&mdash;between her dazed vision and the marvel of a
Mediterranean sunset, leaned the even greater wonder of a
compassionate human face....
</p>

<p>
The glory of the sunset culminated to its utmost splendour.
Floods of blazing wine of rubies poured into the sapphire bowl
of the sea....  The water was calm as a mill-pond,&mdash;the air
was balmy sweetness&mdash;as the evening star kindled, under
the round breast of Asia's radiant moon....  And of all the
innumerable ships that passed and repassed along the crowded
sea-road on the southern horizon, not one altered her course
for the castaway passengers of the luckless <i>Loyalty</i>....
</p>

<p>
They had been so brave, talking and cracking jokes&mdash;singing
even,&mdash;asking riddles, and attempting recitations, "being
British" some of them would have called it&mdash;up to the last volt of
strength....  Towards morning they began to die,&mdash;the Wireless
Operator leading the way, slipping off quite easily....
A baby went next, the only child on shipboard, and its
desperate mother,&mdash;the English wife of a native official at
Malta&mdash;shrieking&mdash;cast loose the rope that lashed her to some floating
deck-fittings and, clutching the tiny body to her&mdash;leaped into
the sea.  And others died of exhaustion, and yet others; until
quavering voices bravely raised in familiar strains of
well-loved hymns, were dumb for sheer despair....  But, after all,
though not until Dawn had risen over the unseen Desert of
Syria&mdash;the boats that had pulled away, came back for yet
another freight....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Are we dead, you and I?" asked Lady Wastwood dreamily,
waking out of an exhausted sleep, in a cabin of the
trooper that had taken the rescued ones on board....
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Katharine Forbis gently, stooping over her.
"It seems that God has yet some work in this world for you
and me to do!"
</p>

<p>
"It is a lonely world," said Trixie faintly, and turned her
peaked face to the bulkhead, "I had done with it!
And&mdash;though it sounds horribly ungrateful, dear!  I am sorry that
you have brought me back!"
</p>

<p>
"But I am glad you aren't dead," said Katharine, kissing
her, "because I love you, and you know that you are fond of
me!"
</p>

<p>
"You saved my life....  I can never forget that," said
Lady Wastwood.  "My dear! there ought to have been somebody
to photograph you doing it!  What a success it would
have made on the screens! ..."  She returned Katharine's
kiss with warmth.  "It's quite true," she said.  "I always have
been fond of you,&mdash;you dear thing!  That is why I was so
frightfully down on poor Edward Yaill!"
</p>

<p>
"Do not&mdash;do not let us go back to that!" begged the other,
wincing.
</p>

<p>
"I remember cutting him," continued Lady Wastwood
reminiscently, "enough to have drawn blood.  My Jerry always
said&mdash;you remember how keen he was on golf?  'Mums carries
too many clubs for one game, and always uses a niblick
when it ought to be a putter!'  But, believe me,&mdash;I really meant
well!"
</p>

<p>
And that was the sealing of a compact of sisterhood
between Katharine and Trixie....  For that we have striven
for we love as part of us....  And Friendship forged on
the anvil of Endurance is a metal that will stand strain.

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
Fresh from great triumphs in France, a Man came to Egypt
in June, 1917&mdash;burly and square-jawed, clear-eyed, vigorous
and outspoken; startlingly young in looks for his fifty-six
years,&mdash;until he removed his cap and you saw his bald, domed
brow.  The successes at Romani and Magdhaba and Rafa had
whiskers.  Plans for the taking of Gaza, that stoutly resisting
stronghold of the Turk&mdash;long since evacuated by all civilians&mdash;had
fizzled out; there was a hang-up somewhere, things had
to be set going again.  He moved G.H.Q. from Cairo to
Kelat, in Southern Palestine&mdash;a huge wire-enclosed area on
the grass-covered slopes within sight of the Mediterranean&mdash;and
took things in hand.  Two Rolls-Royce box-cars carried
him and his Staff,&mdash;three armoured Fords preceded him as
Scouts&mdash;and two others followed with Wireless and life's
necessaries.  So he would appear unexpectedly in various quarters,
causing confusion it may be, to commanding officers&mdash;and
huge contentment to the rank and file.
</p>

<p>
He looked, upon a certain day in July,&mdash;on the positions of
the forces attacking Gaza&mdash;from an observation-point affording
room for three....  The day was misty, the Turkish 5.9 inch
guns were silent; no warning drone of propellers counselled
care as his binoculars swept the enemy trenches towards
Beersheba, noting the railway-system for the shifting of big
guns; the defence-works&mdash;enormously strong, and a tangle of
barbed wire&mdash;running from Beersheba down to the sea.
</p>

<p>
He came down, and went through the trenches asking questions:
sat on a gun-limber eating bully out of a tin with a
jackknife and commended the Engineers and the Egyptian Labour
Corps for the pace at which the railway had followed on the
heels of our Advance.  Then he went away&mdash;and the rations
increased in quantity, and later certain trucks came up by
railway&mdash;containing barrels of a malty liquor much welcome to
the thirsty throats of British soldier-men....
</p>

<p>
Later in October, when the Irish Division, and the Indian
Cavalry and the entire strength of the Camel Transport Corps,
and the London Division which had fought with the assistance
of one John Benn Hazel in France and Macedonia&mdash;had been
added to the army of strange nations now mustered upon
the soil of Palestine,&mdash;and the capture of Beersheba, with the
well-springs of Sheria and the huge Turkish dumps that lay
to the rear of them&mdash;combined with a bombardment from the
hill tops round about her&mdash;from the sea to the West of her and
the hot sky above her&mdash;had brought the gates of Gaza toppling
down,&mdash;he swung into the camp of the battle-weary 'Fenchurch
Streets,' a stalwart stranger in a battered pith helmet, sleeveless
shirt, shorts and canvas shoes; and stooped under the door-fly
of a tent full of dusty undersized Cockneys; unwashed,
unshaven, bone-weary and just lying down to snatch an eyeful
of sleep.
</p>

<p>
"How's things going, Londoners?" he asked with cheery
brevity; and a gaunt brown giant of six feet four with a
bristling two-inch beard, and a portentously hooked nose,
Acting Company Sergeant <i>pro</i> So and so, sick or wounded&mdash;I
forget which&mdash;recognised him, and said in a big bass voice,
displaying a mouthful of large white teeth:
</p>

<p>
"All the better, Sir, because you've come!  We fellows said
all along you'd be the man for the job!"
</p>

<p>
"And, by G&mdash;" he said in his deep strong voice, "if you go
on doing as you've done at Sheria, it won't be long before
we carry through....  See you're wounded....  Anything
much?"  He laid a finger on a naked brown left arm, knotty
with muscle, and decorated above the elbow with a bandage
of iodine-smeared gauze....
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Sir, thank you, but a bit of a flesh-cut.  A German
officer slashed at me with his sword, as he tried to shoot me
left-handed with his revolver."
</p>

<p>
"Moral," he said, with his big schoolboy's chuckle, "don't
try to do two things at once!  And a scratch may turn septic,
in this fly-cursed country, so don't neglect it, man! ..."
</p>

<p>
And he passed on, to gladden the heart of the Battalion
Commander with discriminating praise, and drop a few curt
sentences;&mdash;pregnant with great issues&mdash;before he went away.
Pausing beside the step of his car to ask with the smile that
won the men and charmed the women:
</p>

<p>
"Who's the big tyke overtopping the little Terriers in
F. Company's tent?  Not an exotic in this climate, or I don't
know what it is to command a Jewish Battalion."
</p>

<p>
"I think," said the C.O., "you refer to Private Hazel, Acting
Sergeant to F. Company in place of Langston....  We
call Hazel the 'Lightning Change Artist,' because he's always
doing somebody's duty, and doing it uncommonly well too!
Killed twelve Turks with the bayonet in the scrapping at
Sheria....  Sings as he fights&mdash;a habit when he's butchering
men...."
</p>

<p>
"Sings, does he?  Curious...."
</p>

<p>
"Sings in Hebrew, the men'll swear to you.  Some of them
call him 'The Musical Maccabee.'  We've two other Jews in
the Battalion, both good men, but he's damned good! ... Peculiar
in his refusal of stripes and so forth, else he'd have
had his Commission long ago.  Has the Distinguished
Conduct Medal for something he did in France...."
</p>

<p>
"Glad to hear that.  He seems a hefty kind of beggar.  Have
noticed that he's wounded....  Would you recommend him
for the Military Medal when you're sending in the other
names?"
</p>

<p>
The pleased Colonel reddened through dust and sun-tan:
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Sir, with pleasure, if you'll permit me! ... But
there are a great many names, and I was rather thinking&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear Sir, never under any circumstances think that
there can be too many names!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Sir.  With regard to Acting Sergeant Hazel....
He has been very keen on leave for Alex., since Sheria&mdash;most
unusual thing with a man of that sort to risk the loss of
a scrap.  Some family affair perhaps.  Has big interests in
Palestine&mdash;chiefly wine and olives and so forth.  Kind of a
millionaire, I am told, in his way...."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care a Syrian curse about the millionaire! but
I'm ready to stretch a point to oblige the man who spits
twelve Turks&mdash;and sings while he's doing it!  He's got a
knock from a German, too&mdash;and might have put in for a Red
Cross bag&mdash;a ride in the White train&mdash;and a cane chair on the
lawn at Montana on the strength of it!  So send him down
to railhead at Gamli with the wounded....  He can put in
three weeks at the General Hospital at Alex, and attend to his
business there...."
</p>

<p>
"Very good, Sir!  But it occurs to me that an R.F.C. two-seater
scouting-plane in difficulties came down in our lines
about an hour ago,&mdash;Wing Major Essenian Pasha on board&mdash;an
Egyptian officer from the Ismailia Air Station&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know Essenian Pasha!"  The tone was enigmatical.
"Copt or Moslem,&mdash;nobody seems certain.  Some people seem
to think it's a case of being all things to all men.  Though,&mdash;for
my own part&mdash;if I had to place him&mdash;I'd rank him with
the Advanced or Super-Jews.  But the man's an incomparable
scout, and flies like one of the Sons of Eblis....  Some of
his reports have been damned useful!  We sent for him to do
some special reconnaissance over the enemy's rearguard in the
hills.  Have Djemal's sharpshooters potted the Pasha?  Hope
he'd made his observations first!"
</p>

<p>
"The Pasha's all right, Sir, but his observer was shot dead.
Flying-Lieutenant Usborn&mdash;there was a regular ding-dong
battle over Hebron with some Turkish fighting-planes....
And Essenian Pasha would like us to bury Lieutenant Usborn&mdash;and
supply an observer to replace him for the home-flight
to Ismailia!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, can you?"
</p>

<p>
"It appears, Sir, that the Pasha knows Hazel.  They
foregathered at Salonika a month or so ago.  And there being a
lot of dysentery among the men of the Pasha's Flying Squadron&mdash;and
Hazel having dabbled in aviation&mdash;five-guinea flutters
at Hendon, I suppose!&mdash;the Pasha took him on several
reconnaissance-flights.  By the way, Sir, he has brought in a bit
of intelligence....  The Sherif of Mecca's tribesmen are at
Diariyeh&mdash;among the hills to the N.E. with the Emir Feisal
and a host of Bedwân cavalry.  And they're waging guerilla
warfare against the enemy's rearguards and flanks."
</p>

<p>
"Good for the Sherif Husain!"  The keen blue eyes sparkled.
"And news worth having.  We shall be able to shift
the &mdash;th Division outposts a good bit more to the N.E.  Where's
the Pasha?  <i>Marhabâ</i>, Essenian Pasha!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Marhabtain Gananâr Saiyid!</i>" came the quick response to
the greeting, as he turned to take the report from the dark hand
of the Egyptian Flying Officer, looking back a moment later
to say to the Colonel, with his parting handshake: "Well,
so-long, Colonel!  Remember, your next objective is Huj,
the terminus of the Turkish branch-rail from Deir Sineid.
The Desert Mounted Corps&mdash;3 Cavalry Divisions&mdash;pushed for
there yesterday to cut off the garrison retreating from Gaza.
So-and-so with such-and-such another force of mounted
troops is working round by sea&mdash;to engage the enemy
rear-guard at Beit Hannu.  Dyemal's Eighth Army Corps on our
right flankguard have rolled back towards Hebron."  (Fifteen
miles north-east from Beersheba, among the Judæan Hills.)  "The
only Turks now holding their ground are those facing the
53rd Division at Muweileh.  They may not have heard of the
fall of Gaza&mdash;as we have the cavalry between them and the
rest of their Army&mdash;and Blank smashed the Gaza Wireless
installation when he bombed their big mosque!  You'll find
the road to Huj nicely marked out with Turkish canteens, tin
gas-mask-cases, stretchers and trenching-tools, and the terrain
fairly continuous in its drop,&mdash;about forty feet to the mile....
Don't contemplate much trouble for you from well-posted Austrian
batteries.  The Warwicks and Worcesters and Australians
have accounted for 'em all!"
</p>

<p>
And as the baking Earth rolled up, blotting out the huge
red-hot sun; and the short twilight heralded the sudden swoop
of Night on Syria, the Rolls-Royce box-cars carrying the
Chief and his Staff moved smoothly on, following the four
armoured scouters, and the other Fords swung out and dashed
after them....  And the dust of Philistia&mdash;watered with the
blood of brave men since Wars began on this sad earth&mdash;how
many times? rolled up and blotted out the moving specks, on
the safety of one of which hung the hopes of Christendom.
</p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
To Katharine Forbis, some seven weeks subsequently to
her arrival at the Red Cross Hospital of Montana, an
Egyptian Red Cross orderly brought a scrap of paper bearing a
pencilled scrawl:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Am back from the Front Palestine for ten days leave.
Can you see me?  Important yours faithfully John Hazel.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No more.  But enough to call back the carnation bloom to
cheeks paled by the sub-tropical heats of Egypt, and
self-forgetful labours in the interests of wounded men....
</p>

<p>
Morning duty, consisting in the conveyance of a motor-car
packed with convalescents on an expedition to Ramleh and
back,&mdash;was over.  Miss Forbis had just returned, and was
free for the afternoon.  In her well-cut white drill uniform-skirt
and coat with its shoulder-titles, Special Service badges,
and scraps of medal-ribbon, her white blouse with its polo
collar and natty black silk tie; her brown silk stockings and
tan brogue shoes bearing the unmistakable cachet of Bond
Street, setting off the workmanlike ensemble, and her
handsome head crowned by a soft white Panama hat of the uniform
shape, with the Society's ribbon and badge,&mdash;she made a
gallant, gracious figure, bringing a mist before the eyes of the
big, battered-looking, sun-blackened man,&mdash;bristlier than ever
about the cheeks and chin, and arrayed in battle-soiled and
much-patched khaki drill,&mdash;who got out of his cane chair in
the wide white marble hall with pleased alacrity, knocking over
with a bandaged, sling-suspended left arm, the soiled and
dusty regulation sun-helmet he had put down on a little table
of inlaid Egyptian work.
</p>

<p>
And as he saluted her in his Eastern way, now familiar to
Katharine, swift strangling emotion caught her by the throat.
For a moment she could not find voice.  For John Hazel
brought the panelled parlour at Kerr's Arbour with him; and
set it like a scene between the white marble pillars where
whirred the electric fans, between the gilt and friezed and
painted walls, and under the fretted ceilings of the Egyptian
despot's palace, built on the rocky height at the foot of
which break the milk-warm surges of the Mediterranean.
And once again the old pain at her heart,&mdash;dulled by long
months without news; by change of scene and change of
work, to an aching sense of emptiness,&mdash;woke up and cried
for all that she had lost.
</p>

<p>
She said with her wide heartening smile, as his huge hand
swallowed hers, still wearing its tan gauntlet:
</p>

<p>
"You look wonderfully fit, though you're wearing a sling."
</p>

<p>
"Fit's the word!"  He grinned the big toothy grin so well
remembered....  "A walking testimony to the nutritive qualities
of Maconochie, tinned salmon, Prynn's Baked Beans, Army
brickbats, sticky flycatcher dates and chlorinated Nile water....
For we've travelled a long way since the imbecilities of
the Crimea," he said, with his black eyes drinking her in.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God, we have!"  Katharine flushed a little under
his strange scrutiny, painfully conscious of the unrelaxing
grip of his huge, hard, blackened hand.  For John Hazel
stood, oblivious of its crushing pressure, drinking in the joy
of her near presence, inhaling the rare sweetness of her fair,
wholesome womanhood; the fragrance of her hair and breath,
and garments, coming to him mingled with the perfume of
the half-opened red rose&mdash;still dewy in the heart of it&mdash;that
she had stuck in the buttonhole of her uniform jacket that
morning, and forgotten to take out again.
</p>

<p>
And Katharine upon her side was conscious of a strange
environing atmosphere; a virile, heady compound of exhalations
from the desert, the march, the bivouac and the battlefield,
emanating from the garments and the person of the man.
The sun-baked blackness of his skin seemed its natural tinting.
Whiffs of the wormwood of desolate places mingled with
the aroma of thyme, clover and strong tobacco,&mdash;the smell
of horses and tanned leather; the sharp tang of melinite, and
the penetrating odour of sweating human flesh.
</p>

<p>
A moment more and he released the hand he held, giving
a dismayed exclamation, and taking a long backward step.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on!  What have I been thinking of!"  Concern was
in his voice.  "I'm not fit to touch you!  Do you know it's a
fortnight since I washed last!"  His fleshy mouth twisted in
disgust, as he surveyed his martial griminess, continuing:
"We've been short of water lately.  Only allowed a pint <i>per
diem</i>.  Strictly for internal irrigation, nothing allowed for the
outer man!  And when Essenian Pasha dropped me at the
Alex. Air Station&mdash;and thundering good of him too!&mdash;I'd
only time to grab a bite of breakfast at the N.C.O.'s Mess
Tent&mdash;swallow a mug of coffee&mdash;tumble into a car&mdash;borrowed
from the R.F.C. men!&mdash;and just chuffle along.  Why I was
in such a cast-iron hurry&mdash;that's what I've got to explain to
you.  And when I saw you I clean forgot what a beastly
sweep I am!  I couldn't&mdash;"  The deep, rough breath he drew
added quite plainly, "I couldn't think of anything but you!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you imagine, if you and other brave men can put up
with Dirt for Duty's sake&mdash;that we women&mdash;even those of
us who don't wear this uniform&mdash;can put up with you men?
And you can have a hot bath here at any moment,
Mr. Hazel."  Katharine's full tones were tinged with laughter as she added:
"And a second breakfast,&mdash;unless you don't mind waiting
the half-hour, which will make it the official noonday meal.
Now which will you do?  Have that bath&mdash;or stay and talk
to me on, the lawn or in here until the Staff lunch?&mdash;at which
meal your picturesque battle-grime will make you the
admired of all?"
</p>

<p>
"It's simply first-class here!&mdash;a kind of mix-up of the
Alhambra at Granada and an Egypto-Grecian temple," he
said to her, gratefully sensing the breezes from the whirring
electric fans.  "And that little fountain, splashing and
gurgling&mdash;makes a man who was in the Syrian Desert east of Gaza,
up to the evening of day before yesterday, marching and
swotting Turks on a pint of doctored Nile water <i>per diem</i>&mdash;want
to stick his blooming head in the basin and drink it
all up."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;think I'm beginning to comprehend!"  Miss Forbis's
fine eyebrows relaxed their tension, and the puzzled expression
left her face.  "You fogged me rather, a minute back&mdash;about
being in the Desert near Gaza up to the evening of the
day before yesterday....  But now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Now you're clear that it isn't a case of bats in the belfry.
Haw&mdash;haw!"  He broke out into the big noisy laugh that had
once set Katharine's teeth on edge.  "Of course it'd have
taken three days if I'd come by the Woggler from Railhead.
The Woggler, I ought to tell you, is the Desert Express.  Trucks
roofed with packing-cases nailed together&mdash;nail-ends up&mdash;to
accommodate the troops.  Pullmans,&mdash;seats faked with American
cloth over a thin film of tibbin,&mdash;specially reserved for
Officer Sahibs.  Not that the Army ain't proud of the
Woggler!  In its way, it's an epoch-marking, eye-opening Thing.
But I happened to be in a dithering hurry.  And a chance
turned up of getting here by the Air Route, do you see? ... Safe
as houses, for we followed the coast and had no scraps&mdash;the
Turks are very short of fliers!&mdash;and we only came down
once, for petrol, at a seaplane station near the Rest Camp
at El Arish."
</p>

<p>
The gesture of his blackened hand made light of fatigue,
risks, perils and privations attending the long flight from
Palestine....  Katharine admired the simplicity with which
he spoke, as she said with a touch of reproachfulness:
</p>

<p>
"It seems very long since you came to me at Kerr's Arbour,
Mr. Hazel.  And all these months you have never once
written&mdash;although you promised!"
</p>

<p>
"I said I would not fail to write&mdash;if I had any news for
you!"
</p>

<p>
That deep voice, and the simple words that meant so much
to Katharine....  The white marble pillars of the hall
appeared to sway and totter.  The jewelled plume of a fountain
playing in a fretted basin seemed to leap to the patterned roof
and then shrink small again....
</p>

<p>
"Have you news&mdash;at last?"
</p>

<p>
"Some!" he said briefly.
</p>

<p>
"What?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The sudden dilation and darkening of her lovely eyes betrayed
the desperate hunger gnawing in her.  The eyes fastened
avidly on Hazel's blackened face.  She held her breath for his
answer.  It came as he slewed his head,&mdash;looking through the
triple arch of the Palace vestibule to the green, carefully
nurtured lawn, the glory of Montana&mdash;whence the smack of
racquet upon tennis-ball came, and the sound of cheerful voices,
telling of relaxations on the part of the Medical Staff, the
Nurses and V.A.D's.
</p>

<p>
"This&mdash;that Colonel Yaill is alive and well.  I have seen
him!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" Katharine said, "O&mdash;thank God! ..."
</p>

<p>
She put out her hand to the back of a chair and gripped it
to steady herself.  When her leaping heart had quieted she
addressed herself to a colossal back-view, so shorn of martial
dignity by patches of Army sacking, that Katharine's voice
wavered between laughter and tears:
</p>

<p>
"And God bless you, John Hazel, for bringing word to me!"
</p>

<p>
"I have better than a word!"  He wheeled about and faced
her.  "I have a letter from him for you! ..."
</p>

<p>
As he drew it from a baggy front pocket of his tunic, the
radiance that broke over her was fairly dazzling to the man's
eyes....  He trembled as she stretched out both her hands
to him, entreating:
</p>

<p>
"Give me his letter, dear John Hazel! ... Let me hold it
while you tell me where you met with him! ..."
</p>

<p>
The object that caused such turmoil in Miss Forbis's bosom
was a single sheet of coarse yellow Levantine paper, folded
to oblong shape, stuck in three places along the edge and at
either end, with a mixture of white clay and beeswax, and
sealed with a ring given to Yaill eight years previously.  How
well the giver of the old love-token remembered that hexagonal
sard, deeply cut in old Roman capitals with the name:
"KATHARINE."  How dear and familiar the small neat handwriting
of the pencilled address: 'Miss K. M. Forbis, Kerr's
Arbour, Near Cauldstanes, Tweedshire, N.B.' ...
</p>

<p>
"The morning after Sheria&mdash;before it was daylight"&mdash;how
she hung upon John Hazel's utterance, watching the movements
of his fleshy lips, drinking in every word&mdash;"we were
cleaning out enemy trenches, and blowing up ammunition-dumps
and testing wells for poison, and burying dead Turks&mdash;and
so forth!&mdash;I was passing the Intelligence Officer's
tent&mdash;quite a toney fit-up on the top of a mound&mdash;with a native
string-bed, and a camp chair, and a sugar-box table, and
lighted candles on that,&mdash;for the thermometer was climbing
up into the seventies and the front fly was up&mdash;for the sake of
fresh air....  When I tell you that the I.O. was questioning
Turkish prisoners&mdash;under a guard of Military Police,&mdash;and
putting Syrian and Arab scouts through their paces, and
interviewing village patriarchs&mdash;you'll understand that the
atmosphere was&mdash;well!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can imagine! ... But, do please go on!"  All unconsciously
she cuddled the precious letter to her bosom, holding
it with both hands and smiling over it at John....
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;as I was passing by and happened to glance in&mdash;an
Arab dressed much the same as the others&mdash;a thin, tallish,
sinewy Bedawi in a flowing black camel-cloth mantle, and silk
head-veil trimmed with tufts of coloured gimp&mdash;and topped
by the usual ring of twisted camel's hair,&mdash;rose up and made
obeisance to the Intelligence Officer sitting at the sugar-box
table,&mdash;and came out, followed by a brace of others&mdash;not
quite so well got up.  Walking as Arabs have the knack of
doing&mdash;as if the round world and all that therein is&mdash;including
the Desert&mdash;was hardly good enough to be trampled under
the notched iron heels that they wear for killing snakes."
</p>

<p>
She drank in the words that were heavenly music, bending
her high head the better to concentrate her gaze upon the
speaker's face.
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the three Arabs&mdash;two of 'em not particularly
interesting, and the one who'd been talking to the Intelligence
Officer&mdash;no end posh in a necklace of gold-mounted lion's-teeth,
and with strings of blue and red seed-pearls twined in
his long side-locks,&mdash;the three Arabs were going to where their
hairies were picketed&mdash;munching tibbin and sesame off a
spread saddle-cloth&mdash;ragged looking yellowish-grey brutes
with ewe-necks, and queerly-sloped cruppers; and high-peaked
wooden saddles and big-bitted bridles, jingling with silver
amulets and jewellery of sorts....  One Arab had a kind of
cage-basket strapped on behind the saddle, with live birds
stirring about in it&mdash;I thought falcons trained for sport&mdash;until
they started cooing....  Well then!&mdash;in the sudden way it
happens in this East of ours,&mdash;Day jumped over the Hills
of Judea&mdash;and the Arabs got their prayer-rugs from behind
their saddles, and made ready to say their prayers...."
</p>

<p>
His black eyes seemed to look past Katharine into the
scene that he described.  He drew breath:
</p>

<p>
"I was sitting on a sack of Turkish ration-biscuits&mdash;not
half bad if you've nothing else to eat!&mdash;smoking an Army
Issue Woodbine&mdash;and though the place was stiff with praying
Moslems, I watched these&mdash;or rather this one!  He washed
in the sand&mdash;laid his praying-rug diagonally in the line for
Mecca, knelt down, and went through the whole programme&mdash;praying
with his forehead to the ground&mdash;praying with his
hands to the sides of his head&mdash;praying with his body straight,
resting on the knees, in the regular Mohammedan way.  An
uncommonly swanky Arab too!&mdash;the stock of his long-barrelled
gun inlaid with bits of turquoise and mother o' pearl,
a curved nine-inch dagger in a gilded sheath stuck in the front
of his girdle&mdash;and a long silver-plated ivory-stocked
revolver&mdash;about 44 calibre I judge&mdash;on the other side.  I was to left
of him: so when he slewed his head over his right shoulder
to smile at his Good Angel, I saw the back of it&mdash;and when
he twirled it back again to scowl at the Counsellor of Evil, I
found him staring full into my face and scowling at me!"
</p>

<p>
"And you knew him!&mdash;it was Edward!"  Her voice was
a song of joy!

<p>
"I'd seen that scowl on the terrace at Kerr's Arbour, last
February," said John Hazel.  "And though he gave no other
sign to tell that he recognised me, his eyes flickered for the
tenth of a second&mdash;and I saw they weren't black, but grey.
He took no more notice of me....  He'd finished his prayer,
and was squatting down cross-legged&mdash;running his beads
between his fingers&mdash;so I pitched away my fag-end, and began
to hum the tune of a song, sitting on the sack of Turkish
Army biscuits.  It might have been an English hymn&mdash;for
all the genuine Arabs knew&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What was the song?"
</p>

<p>
"'Loch Lomond'&mdash;only the words were altered; to fit the
situation&mdash;see?  Something like this:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'So I took the high-road<br>
  And you took the low,<br>
  And you got to Asia before me!<br>
  And Katharine Forbis sat waiting for news<br>
  At the bonny, bonny house of Kerr's Arbour!'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Muted down to the softness of a mother's cradle-song, the
full mellow baritone breathed out the familiar refrain.
Bringing tears brimming over Katharine's under-lids,&mdash;for by
strangest chance the song was one of Edward's favourites,
often sung by her to him in the twilight&mdash;in the dear familiar
drawing-room of the old, distant home....
</p>

<p>
"So you....  It was wonderful of you to speak to him
in that way! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Not original."  He grinned at her.  "A variation on the
historic Blondel Stunt.  Only Blondel was a London Tommy,&mdash;and
Cœur de Lion a British Brass Hat, camouflaged as a Son
of Islam.  He took it like a rock, only I saw his eyelid quiver.
Yes'm!&mdash;that descendant of the Prophet winked at the infidel
with the eye that was next me....  Then I did a bit more of
the Blondel dodge...."
</p>

<p>
The smile ceased to quirk the corners of his fleshy red
mouth, as he sang under his breath in the full sweet baritone:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O Julian her brother was killed long ago!<br>
  So seek you no further to find him!<br>
  And give me a letter to take to her now<br>
  Where she's working for the Red Cross at Alex.!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"And what then? ..."  Her colour came and went....
"Didn't Edward&mdash;didn't Colonel Yaill manage somehow to
speak to you privately? ..."
</p>

<p>
John Hazel shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Nix a word!  He's far too old a hand at the risky business
of walking about in another man's skin, to give himself
away in that style.  He got up and shook off the dust,&mdash;stepped
into his loose gazelle-leather boots,&mdash;rolled up his carpet,
mounted and rode off with his two Arabs&mdash;leaving me chewin'
the rag!  And yet I knew it was Yaill&mdash;and that he'd got my
message!"
</p>

<p>
"What did you do then? ..."
</p>

<p>
"What did I do! ..."
</p>

<p>
Forgetful in the excitement of his story, of his damaged
left arm, he had released it from the sling, and used it freely,
in the supple illustrative gesticulations that bespoke his
Eastern blood:
</p>

<p>
"What?  O, I sat tight on the sack of rooty, and smoked
another fag, until the sun got too hot even for me!  Then I
got up and stretched myself, and caught my chameleon&mdash;who'd
been trying to desert&mdash;and put him back on my <i>sola topi</i>.
We all wear chameleons on our helmets, khaki drill or the
tin basin variety&mdash;the beasts are champion fly-destructors!&mdash;and
I believe that's how dragons, and wyverns, and other
metal wild-fowl of that kind came to be worn on Crusaders'
helms as crests....  Then I hied me back to my bivvy&mdash;it was
in a cave of the Wady Sheria, and had been used by the
natives for keeping goats&mdash;and other lively skippers!&mdash;and
breakfasted with some mates of mine&mdash;chaps belonging to my
Platoon.  I think the menu consisted of rissoles, made of
bully-beef with onion, biscuit-crumbs and sand-flies; the bottom
of a tin of Dundee marmalade,&mdash;more sand-flies!&mdash;burned-bean
coffee, and dates&mdash;with sand-flies again.  Barely finished
when we got the route.  Our Division were to follow up
Djemal Pasha's Eighth Army Corps&mdash;what was left of
'em&mdash;over the hills towards Hebron, and before my company
marched off, a message came for me.  The Intelligence Officer
wanted to speak to Acting Company-Sergeant Hazel&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flashed comprehension:
</p>

<p>
"Edward! ... My letter! ... Ah!  I understand! ..."
</p>

<p>
He nodded:
</p>

<p>
"It was the one way to get the thing to me without drawing
suspicion....  And it was given me in a similarly&mdash;unobtrusive
style.  It lay before the I.O. on the packing-box table
with a lump of mica schist on top of it for a paper-weight.
Says Intelligence: 'Acting-Sergeant Hazel, I believe you have
undertaken to forward this? ... The writer is much obliged!'  So
I saluted, and stuffed it in my pocket, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;what?" cried Katharine Forbis, for the brown face
had changed to an ugly livid colour, as John Hazel swayed
giddily and caught at a column near.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much! ... Got the sun on my head a bit yesterday.
Right as rain in a minute&mdash;if&mdash;if I may sit down?
But ... don't wait....  You haven't read your letter!  And
you must hate me for keeping you from that!"
</p>

<p>
He sat down heavily in the chair she drew to him, feeling
her cool firm hand touch his wrist and her long womanly
fingers encircle it, hearing her worshipped voice speaking
close by:
</p>

<p>
"If one can hate one's kindest, truest friend, who has done
so much&mdash;so simply and unselfishly&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He shook his dizzy head in his heavy buffalo-like fashion,&mdash;and
muttered through the whirring of the electrically-driven
ventilating-fans:
</p>

<p>
"What have I done?  Nothing much, anyway!"
</p>

<p>
"You have flown to me out of the midst of battle, bringing
Edward's dear message....  Wounded and with a touch of
fever, or I don't deserve my nurse's certificate!  Do you call
that nothing? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Little or nothing!"  He shook his great black head
doggedly as Katharine went on:
</p>

<p>
"And I take it as my right!  What claim have I to such
service?"
</p>

<p>
"Every claim," said Hazel's deep voice.  "Every imaginable
right!"
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;"  Her voice broke between tears and laughter:&mdash;"And
you encourage me in selfishness.  Why, I haven't even
asked you if you wouldn't like a drink! ..."
</p>

<p>
"A drink!" he said with his old grin, though the brown of
his face still showed faded, and deep lines showed by his jaws
and at the wings of his great hooked nose.  "A brandy and
Polly with a lump of ice, and a ring of lemon in it.  Offer
me one now, Miss Forbis&mdash;and hear it boil as it goes down!"
</p>

<p>
"You shall have it."  Katharine said laughing, though once
her lip would have curled in scorn of the vulgarity of the
ex-insurance-broker.  "But first you must come to the
Out-Patient's Department, and let the Surgeon in charge there
look at this arm....  A mere nothing, perhaps, as you say"&mdash;for
John was beginning to explain about its being a flesh-cut....
"When was it dressed last? ... The day before
yesterday! ... That's quite enough....  You will come with
me! ..."
</p>

<p>
So John Hazel, thrilling with well-concealed joy at being
the object of his lady's solicitude, was towed away to a
tile-lined, cement-floored Department on the Palace ground-floor,
where the sword-cut on his left arm, looking rather angry&mdash;was
bathed and cleaned, iodined, and strapped up by the doctor
and nurse on duty there....  And the longed-for goblet of
iced brandy and Apollinaris having been produced and duly
disposed of&mdash;John Hazel took leave of Miss Forbis and went
upon his way.
</p>

<p>
"Where shall you be? ... What address will find you?"
she asked as she gave him her hand in farewell....
</p>

<p>
"I'm supposed to be quartered at a General Hospital at
Alex....  Number Thirty-Seven," returned John.  "But I'm
not due there until to-morrow morning, and I'm going to
wangle leave to live and sleep at my own house...."
</p>

<p>
"Your house! ... Have you a house at Alexandria? ..."
</p>

<p>
"We have had a house at Alexandria for more than sixteen
hundred years!"
</p>

<p>
Again Antiquity rose up and confronted Katharine in the
person of this big young man of powerfully Semitic type.
He went on:
</p>

<p>
"Of course I never saw it until the Division came to Egypt.
I went over from Kantara, and entered into possession a
week or so before we got the route for Palestine....  I like
it! ... You would like it....  It is the kind of place that's
bound to interest you&mdash;for several reasons....  One of them
being that it's a wonderfully preserved example of Roman-Egyptian
Domestic Architecture.  A relic of Alexandria&mdash;as
Alexandria used to be...."
</p>

<p>
Katharine said with her characteristic sweet heartiness,
though Yaill's letter was burning to be read:
</p>

<p>
"I should love to visit your house at Alexandria&mdash;if I may
bring a friend with me? ... Lady Wastwood, who came out
with me on the poor Hospital ship <i>Loyalty</i> and has been very
ill here.  She is convalescent now and helping us in the
Secretarial Department, until she is fit to take over her own work.
And I believe she is rather keen on ancient inscriptions,
cat-headed goddesses and crowned <i>uræi</i>&mdash;and all that sort of
thing."
</p>

<p>
"Then will you both honour me by coming to tea with me
in the City to-morrow?&mdash;Numero VII, Rue el Farad,&mdash;I'll
have a car waiting for you at the Palace gateway by sharp
half-past four."
</p>

<p>
He smiled, well pleased, as Katharine consented; and heaved
up his great body, and reached for the battered drill sun-helmet,
as the silvery note of the luncheon-gong sounded from
the long corridor crossing the bottom of the pillared
entrance-hall.
</p>

<p>
"That's settled then....  Thanks all the same!&mdash;but I won't
stay to luncheon....  Do you think I don't know how you're
longing to get rid of me&mdash;and run away and shut yourself
up, and read what you've got there! ..."
</p>

<p>
His black eyes went significantly to the outline of Yaill's
letter, thrust by Katharine between the buttons of her white
silk blouse, when&mdash;at some juncture of the wound-dressing in
the Out-Patient's Department&mdash;she had come to the help of
the surgeon and charge-Sister with deft, accustomed hands.
</p>

<p>
Her fine brows frowned a little at the familiarity, but there
was no use in being angry with the man.  John Hazel was
just&mdash;John Hazel&mdash;Miss Forbis told herself; as standing in the
sun-blaze on the doorsteps of the Hospital, she watched his
great figure stride down the sanded avenue of swaying
casuarina-trees, on the way to find the borrowed car left waiting
at the entrance-gates.
</p>

<p>
Women and doctors and V.A.D. members were streaming
towards the Palace from every quarter,&mdash;but for Katharine the
Staff luncheon-gong issued its second summons in vain.  She
was hurrying down a shady side-alley of cypresses and
tamarisks&mdash;ending in a pavilion of marble fretwork&mdash;covered with
the royal mantle of a great Bougainvillia&mdash;standing in a riotous
tangle of November-blooming roses,&mdash;a dear resort of hers
and Lady Wastwood's in their free unworking hours....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oh!</i> just like a girl of nineteen!" she murmured, conscious
of the thrill and tumult of her fair soul and pure body as she
drew Yaill's letter from its fragrant hiding-place.
</p>

<p>
Ah, my Katharine, but there you were wonderfully mistaken.
Miss Nineteen would have failed to experience one-tenth
of your blissful emotion as you kissed the folded sheet
of coarse Eastern paper,&mdash;broke the clay and beeswax seals
bearing the impression of your love-gift, the cut
sardonyx&mdash;and read the words penned but a few days previously by
Yaill's beloved hand.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "<i>A Camp In The North Syrian Desert,<br>
  &mdash;th November&mdash;the Month of Asphodel.</i><br>
  "KATHARINE, MY SWEET WOMAN, MY DEAR LOST LOVE."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So wild a surge of memories came over her that her eyes
were momentarily blinded.  He dated from his camp in the
Desert, as a pearler on some plunging lugger in the Indian
Ocean may top his home-destined scribble: "The Open
Sea...."
</p>

<p>
She dried her eyes, and the lines were clear again.  Something
that the folded sheet had contained had dropped out.  A
white flower scarcely yet withered, and a little string of beads
of some sort.  She thrust them in the envelope&mdash;and the
envelope in her bosom&mdash;and went on to read....  And the page
exhaled the wild strange odour of the acrid dust of the Desert,
mingled with the scent of horses and camels, of saffron and
resin, tobacco and thyme and myrrh....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Twice I have seen your advertisements, my beloved.  In
a Greek gazette in a <i>café</i> at Constantinople.  Again, in an
issue of the <i>Lisân-el-Arab</i>, a vernacular paper published at
Damascus; once again on a torn scrap of a captured Turkish
news-sheet, on the floor of the <i>maktab</i> of the Governor of
Akaba&mdash;the seaport at the head of the Gulf, where the Fleet
of King Solomon unloaded their freights of ivory and ebony,
gold and spices and apes and peacocks, close on three
thousand years ago.
</p>

<p>
"How did I come there? do you ask me, Katharine.  What
was I doing in the hall where the Governor gives audience to
the Bringers of News from the Desert&mdash;sitting on the Carpet
of Interrogation, smoking the <i>argili</i> that aids thought?
Because I was one of them&mdash;am one of them!&mdash;a petty chief
of the Hejaz Bedwân, able to speak a little English&mdash;a spy
set to supervise the doings of the spies.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I picked up the paper, as became a scrupulous
Mohammedan.  Who knew that it did not bear the letters of
The Sacred Name!  And I kissed it, and burned it on the
charcoal of the brazier, under sharp eyes that had not
glittered on the message it brought to me.  Though the Governor
of Akaba is one of those few men who share my secret.  Had
One great man not known it from the first, it would not have
been possible to have vanished into thin air with such celerity.
</p>

<p>
"You never doubted for a single moment, sweet friend, dear
comrade! that I had gone to look for Julian.  Had I believed
you would think otherwise, I would have managed to write
to you....  But not to write was wiser&mdash;and the plan
matured so suddenly....  When I took my last kiss from you,
and went out of the chapel at Kerr's Arbour, I was uncertain
what to do.
</p>

<p>
"Then through the jungle of my thoughts I saw a way
blazed for me.  I went to my room, and took from the press
an old tweed shooting-suit, and hung the things on my arm,
under my waterproof trench-coat.  I took my stick, and shook
hands with Whishaw, and said Good-bye to him.  His old
eyes were red with tears, and my grip thanked him for them.
Then I climbed the private road, and turned at the brae-top
to take my farewell look of Kerr's Arbour.  And oddly
enough, the refrain from 'Loch Lomond' kept droning in my
head.  You were taking the high-road of Duty and Honour&mdash;and
I was taking the road of subterfuge and concealment.
But not, God knew! for any base end of mine!  He
Whose Hand has torn us apart&mdash;two lovers married in heart
and soul&mdash;if ever lovers were,&mdash;my Katharine!&mdash;He must be
just to me!  Harsh though I knew him,&mdash;yet even then I saw
He had tempered His harshness with mercy.  For you, O my
dearest&mdash;you had believed in me!
</p>

<p>
"So I took initiative from that, and followed the plan I
had thought of.  I changed in the plantation opposite, but
rather below, the gate of Kerr's Arbour private road.  Then&mdash;seeing
no one but a child&mdash;I came out of the plantation, having
buried my khaki kit in a biggish badger's burrow.  Cauldstanes
people knew my face&mdash;so I struck across country for Stotts
Junction, some twenty miles farther South, where&mdash;as of
course you know&mdash;the Carlisle-bound trains stop.  I got in at
midnight&mdash;the time most favourable&mdash;as a troop-train of dingy
second-class carriages and the usual string of cattle-trucks
lumbered in.
</p>

<p>
"Troops were entraining, the &mdash;th Lowland Territorials,
bound for Havre, Marseilles and the East.  In the seething
turmoil of my mind, some vague idea of enlisting as a ranker
had been uppermost.  I dismissed it as I sat waiting for the
next Carlisle-bound train.
</p>

<p>
"My twenty-mile tramp to the Junction had cleared away
the brainstorm.  I realised that I had acted without reflection,
like a savage, or a child.  Stuffing away the khaki husk of
Edward Yaill in a red-hot hurry,&mdash;changing into the old
tweeds, and launching back into the world as an unobtrusive
civilian, was, in a country in a state of War, and under Martial
Law, about the crudest and riskiest mode of escape I could
have chosen.
</p>

<p>
"But I got to London safely without being asked for papers,
and slept at a coffee-house in the King's Cross Road.  Next
day, quite early, I saw Sir Arthur Ely, told him my plans
(which he did not approve of), left in his care my keys
and private papers; and by an ante-dated cheque which he
passed through his bankers&mdash;obtained sufficient ready cash to
carry on for a couple of years.
</p>

<p>
"And then I telegraphed in Code to a man I loved and
honoured.  You know him.  He showed me much friendship
when I was in the East.  He wired back, appointing a
place and an hour.  The straight, piercing look of his full
eyes under their thick lids&mdash;the grip of his hand, and the sound
of his deep voice, rolled back the years&mdash;they always did&mdash;and
made me a boy again.  For I was little more when,
eighteen years ago, I brought a despatch from my Colonel
to his Headquarters at Fort Atbara.  I was a lieutenant on his
Staff when from the hill-top behind Kerreri&mdash;he&mdash;the
Sirdar&mdash;swept Omdurman with his binoculars.  A mud-walled
Mohammedan city&mdash;I have been back there since I left you,
Katharine!&mdash;with a great host of white-robed Darweeshes in
battle-array before it&mdash;and the whitewashed dome of the
Mahdi's tomb all gleaming in the sun.
</p>

<p>
"He is dead&mdash;and in him England has lost much more than
a great War Minister.  She has lost her truest friend.  He
heard my story out and believed me,&mdash;even as you believed,
my true love!  He was ready to help, upon condition that I
followed up definite lines....
</p>

<p>
"Arab co-operation being essential for the crushing of the
Red Crescent, and the liberation of Northern Palestine and
Syria&mdash;a door lay open towards the East for a man such as I
was&mdash;such as I am! who does not greatly fear peril, having
no great use for existence.  To whom hardship signifies little,
comfort and pleasure not being for him.  Who welcomes
loneliness because denied the one companion with whom life
would be Life indeed.
</p>

<p>
"So I got my Mission from my Chief of old,&mdash;he being
willing that my six months of Home leave, and the indefinite
period of Home duty destined to follow it,&mdash;should be merged,
for an equally indefinite period, in a Mission connected with
the Secret Intelligence Service of Great Britain in the East.
Now you know why I was sitting in the audience-hall of the
Governor of Akaba when I saw that torn fragment of the
Turkish news-sheet lying, and picked it up and read, for the
second time, your message to me.
</p>

<p>
"Twice then I have seen your message, and once I have
seen You.  You were driving a Red Cross Daimler car, full
of Hospital convalescents, six weeks ago near the ruins of
Canopus, by Aboukir.  I was not an Arab of the Hejaz on
that never-to-be-forgotten morning.  Perhaps I was that
coffee-coloured Copt&mdash;in the blue cotton <i>galabiyeh</i> of the
Egyptian Labour Corps&mdash;squatting on a sandheap near a gang
of others busy at excavation....  Or I may have been the
Australian Dinkum who leaned against a Ptolemaic pillar
smoking a cigarette....  You remember that his felt hat was
slouched so as to hide his eyes!
</p>

<p>
"I do not smile, though I write cheerfully.  Imagine what
it would feel like to have a farrier thrust his steel pincers into
your breast and twist your live heart round?  Well, that is
what I felt that day when I saw you at Aboukir.  And yet
I did not yield to the desire to speak to you&mdash;or try to see you,
or communicate with you in any way.  For to do that might
have balked me of reaching my end,&mdash;prevented me from
doing what I am more than ever bent on....  Had not Hazel
recognised me that day near Sheria, I swear to you I would
have resisted&mdash;until the finish.  Perhaps I have drunk in a
belief in Destiny from the Arabs.  But I feel that man John
Hazel is linked up with my Fate!
</p>

<p>
"So I write: and this will be conveyed to him through the
officer representing &mdash;th Division, British Secret Intelligence,
who firmly believed me,&mdash;until I disillusioned him&mdash;to be the
Emir Fadl Anga, a pigeon-fancying petty Arab chief of the
tag-rag-and-bob-tail of the Sherif of Mecca.  Fortunately
for my peace of mind!  For the time is ripe....  I have traced
a leakage of information from Headquarters in Egypt to its
source in a native officer who holds the confidence of the
British Government&mdash;and now move to the centre where the
spy's activities are manifested.  On the completeness of
disguise&mdash;not only the garb of the outer man,&mdash;and the technical
proprieties of speech and bearing&mdash;but the mentality
distinguishing an Arab nomad from a city-inhabiting European&mdash;hang
the two issues:&mdash;that a traitor should meet the fate he
richly merits,&mdash;and that out of the barren desert of my life
I may gather a joy for Katharine.
</p>

<p>
"For Julian is alive!&mdash;sweet friend, lost sweetheart!  He
sends you the Rosary that comes with this.  He has been
shifted four times since the Turks took him prisoner on the
Scimitar.  From Gallipoli to a War Hospital staffed by German
surgeons, and Bulgarian and German nurses of the Red
Crescent, at Constantinople.  From Hospital to a filthy Prison
Camp near Smyrna.  From Smyrna to Belemeki, a small and
even filthier station in the Taurus Mountains&mdash;the
headquarters for labour-gangs of prisoners working on the
uncompleted tunnels of the Adana and Constantinople rail.  From
thence to Beersheba and Shechem.  He is now at Shechem.
In such misery and under such privations that to describe
them would harrow you uselessly....  I do not mean to try....
But this you may know: that the starved and vermin-ridden
mob of tatterdemalions,&mdash;British Yeomanry, Regulars,
Australians, Indians, Jews, Frenchmen and Roumanians&mdash;who
swelter and starve and toil at Shechem under the loaded
Turkish hide-whips would be in infinitely worse case, but for the
self-effacing tenderness of the priest whom even the Turkish
guards have learned to respect.  Recent negotiations between
the Allied Governments and the Porte have brought about a
movement towards the release or exchange of many of these
prisoners....  But for some reason,&mdash;the name of Father
Julian Forbis has been omitted from the official lists of those
selected for exchange.  His physical sufferings, I have learned,
would have been lessened if he would have consented to be
removed from the mud barrack-prison, and quartered in the
huts of the Wired Enclosure east of the town with the officers,&mdash;who
receive less villainous treatment&mdash;and are more decently
housed than the men....  It was like the Julian whom we
know, not to desert his charges; knowing his presence to be
some check upon the inhumanity of Turkish officials, and the
brutality of Turkish guards.  Pray for your living brother, my
beloved,&mdash;for it may be God will hear you! and for me who
am no better than dead though living,&mdash;being cut off hopelessly
from you....  If in dreams I kiss your eyes, and your
sweet mouth,&mdash;and the soft little place under your chin, you
cannot be angry....  For I have nothing left on earth but my
one hope of rescuing Julian, and my dreams!&mdash;and they come
every night, Katharine!&mdash;such cruelly-sweet,&mdash;vivid dreams of
you and you, and You....  E.A.Y."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a postscript above a rough ink outline that
suggested something familiar to Katharine:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I picked the flower I enclose with the Rosary a day or
so back at your Tower of Kir Saba, little thinking how soon
I should be sending it to you!  The Turks holding Jaffa have
fortified the Tower on the E. and S.:&mdash;fixed an aërial for
Wireless on the top of it&mdash;driven their trenches through the
gardens and vineyards&mdash;cut down the olive-groves covering
the hillside N,&mdash;and used the vaults as dumps for the storage
of cartridges, H.E. shell, bombs and hand-grenades....
There is something of Kerr's Arbour about the place, despite
the second, smaller Tower to the W, the round bastion at the
middle of the eastward wall, and the absence of the buildings
later reared against the keep....  So there, my Katharine,
stands your ancient heritage, its feet deep in blossoming
asphodel, and tapestries of grape-vines&mdash;now laden with ripe
fruit&mdash;draping its Time-worn stone...."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The withered flower the envelope had contained was the
snapped-off top of a slender green stem, bearing white blossoms
in branching clusters; lily-shaped, and exhaling a delicate
fragrance, recalling the scent of freesia to Katharine.
</p>

<p>
The Rosary was a hempen string, with brown-black shiny
seeds of the oval type of <i>canna Indica</i>, arranged in the familiar
decades&mdash;with black lupin-beans for Paternosters&mdash;ending in a
Crucifix rudely hacked from palm-wood&mdash;fruit of hours of
secret labour with the prisoner's pocket-knife....
</p>

<p>
Katharine knew that Julian must have blessed it, before
sending it to Edward.  Thenceforth in daily prayers to the
Mother of Consolation, for her dear ones living and dead,
she would use instead of her own Rosary this:&mdash;made even
more sacred by the sorrow of the sender and the maker's
martyrdom.

<h3>
VI
</h3>

<p>
In search of Lady Wastwood, temporarily busy in that
Department, Katharine later on betook herself to the cool
and pleasant quarters on the Palace second floor, devoted to
Secretarial Work and Accounts.
</p>

<p>
"Be good enough to explain why you cut the Staff lunch
to-day?" Miss Forbis said with severity, as Trixie's white
triangular face and bright green eyes came out of a big
parchment ledger to smile a tired welcome at her friend.
</p>

<p>
"Because of the food!" said Lady Wastwood briefly.
</p>

<p>
"The food is ripping!" pronounced Miss Forbis.
</p>

<p>
"I admit that!  It's seeing you other people eat it that I
mind!"
</p>

<p>
"So you avoid meals, and live on eggs and coffee, and fresh
dates, and figs and bananas and grapes and custard-apples.
You'll be in for Gippy Tummy if you don't take care!"
</p>

<p>
"Precious Person, I will take care.  But fruit is so simply
gorgeous here!&mdash;and it reminds me of Old Diplomatic Service
days at Constantinople and Calcutta, when I and Wastwood
used to eat figs and mangoes and fresh-picked oranges
one against the other, for bets in gloves.  And neither of us
died&mdash;though I suppose we ought to have.  Don't go, my
dinkie!  I'm nearly done!"
</p>

<p>
And Trixie, coming out of the big ledger with a sheaf of
pencilled extracts, arranged a huge sheet of foolscap on the
blotter and began to write, while Katharine waited, looking
out of the window across the lawns and the elaborately-cultivated
shrubberies to the line where the blue sea,&mdash;traversed
by innumerable Allied steamers,&mdash;and the bluer sky, threaded
by French and British aircraft&mdash;met and mingled beyond a
wide expanse of light brown sand-dunes, and a belt of
casuarina-trees, and tall, waving palms:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Report On The Working of the Red Cross Motor-Ambulance
and Cars For the Month of October, 1917.
</p>

<p>
"During October our 11 Cars used for General Administrative
Work and for the Conveyance of Convalescents, ran
9576 miles on 636 gallons of petrol, making an average of
15.05 miles to the gallon.
</p>

<p>
"159 Convalescent Patients were taken out for Drives,
and nearly all of them given tea at the Nouzah Gardens&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I wonder," Katharine began, after watching the long thin
hand move over the paper for a minute or so, "whether you
ought to be doing that?"
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood's incredibly arched, impossibly-black eyebrows
moved nearer her green-golden hair.
</p>

<p>
"Because my heart goes biff after a ducking, I resolutely
decline to be treated as an invalid.  Isn't it bad enough to
know that another woman is doing my work of organisation
at the Convalescent Officers' Hostel at El Naza&mdash;and
doing it on rottenly unimaginative lines!  A woman more than
a dozen years younger,&mdash;who learned from me in the days
of flapperdom how to camouflage a shiny nose?  No, you
mustn't try to take my work from me.  It helps me to forget
my unrealised visions of green lawns of rabbia shaded with
palms and dotted with snow white sleeping tents, and golden
haired English nurses in pale blue linen overalls, ministering
to hundreds of weary War-worn men."
</p>

<p>
"But the nurses mightn't all have been golden-haired,"
objected Katharine.
</p>

<p>
"Peroxide," said Lady Wastwood, brainily, "is fairly cheap
in Egypt.  And I know a Contractor who would have supplied
it in seven gallon glass jars."  Her small triangular face
regained its old vivacity, and her green eyes their brilliancy as
she pursued: "Then, I meant, to have a restaurant built far
out on the sea shore, where the surf ran up under the tables as
the patients sat at lunch, or tea.  Rowing, riding and fishing,
camel-rides and picnics would have been part of the treatment
under my <i>régime</i>.  And now&mdash;"  Trixie's voice wobbled
a little and she cautiously dabbed with a minute lawn handkerchief
at the corners of her bright green eyes&mdash;"when I think
of all those Convalescent Officers and what they have lost
through Me, I get pippy.  To have pulled the thing through
and made a success of it would have got back my credit with
Wastwood and the boys."
</p>

<p>
"My dear!" Katharine began, and hesitated: "You don't
believe <i>really</i>&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Trixie dabbed her eyes again,&mdash;and dabbed her nose as an
afterthought, and resolutely put away the handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite think Wastwood&mdash;my husband&mdash;would judge
me hardly.  He took me three times round the world with
him, and though I was a jelly of terror all the time at sea, I
somehow managed to camouflage my cowardice.  It's only
when I remember how I groused on that ship that I imagine
I can hear my Jerry saying to his brother: 'Old Man, I don't
half like to say it, but the Mums is rather letting us down
... What?'  And Wastwood&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If Wastwood or Jerry said anything so unjust," Katharine
broke out, "they ought to&mdash;to be thoroughly well
spanked&mdash;both of them!"  She went on as Trixie reluctantly
yielded to laughter, "I don't know whether you've found it
out yet,&mdash;but Nurse-Superintendent Bulleyne is in charge
of No. 2 Ground Floor Ward at the Harem.  And she has
told Lady Donnithorpe and every one else here how&mdash;when
the Incendiary Bomb from the Zeppelin dropped through the
roof of No. 100, West Central Square&mdash;where you used to
have your Red Cross Work Rooms,&mdash;and killed two poor
orderlies, and dear Alicia Macintosh!&mdash;you went into action
with sand-boxes and water-buckets, and fire-extinguishers,&mdash;and
saved the place from being burned out! ..."
</p>

<p>
"That was nothing to brag about," declared Trixie.  "Things
that go off with a bang and a piff never much frighten me,
and anyone with an iota of sense knows what to do in a fire.
But shipwreck"&mdash;she shuddered "and drowning&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Katharine saw the look on the white triangular face, and
came to Trixie's side protectingly.  Ever since the sinking of
the Hospital Transport <i>Loyalty</i>, the terrible experience had
been renewed in Lady Wastwood's nightly dreams.  She
looked frailer and more startlingly attenuated than ever, as
she sat among the ledgers heading a fresh sheet of foolscap:

"Come now, you really have done enough.  Stop at the
Bishop."
</p>

<p>
"I wish he would pay the freightage on his stupid sermons.
Forty piastres to pay on the parcel.  And he expects to be
thanked for it.  Well, I'll knock off if you'll come and laze
with me for a bit in the garden....  Do I shine?  I feel
like it!"
</p>

<p>
Trixie gathered up her long thin limbs, stood up and
produced a vanity-case.
</p>

<p>
"Here and there....  But every one does....  I'm beginning
to get used to it.  No!  I'm not coming to smoke your
new Macedonian cigarettes, and have iced-tea with lemon in
the garden this afternoon.  You are coming to tea with me,
in the house of a great friend of mine."
</p>

<p>
"Who is your friend?" asked Trixie, intent on the little
circular mirror.
</p>

<p>
"A Jew."
</p>

<p>
"I rather like Jews.  Where does your friend live?"
</p>

<p>
"Numero VII., Rue el Farad, Alexandria.  His house,"
Katharine went on, quoting John Hazel, "is one of the few
relics extant of the ancient city, a wonderfully-preserved
example of the Roman-Egyptian Domestic Style."
</p>

<p>
"'I guess I shall admire to come,' as that American
Nursing-Sister said when you asked her to drive to the Antoniadis
Gardens.  And is your friend like his house&mdash;a wonderfully
preserved example of the ancient what-do-you-call-it style?"
</p>

<p>
Katharine answered promptly and warmly:
</p>

<p>
"He certainly is a wonderfully-preserved example of
unspoiled Faith, and unstained Honour, and old-world Loyalty."
</p>

<p>
"How nice!" said Lady Wastwood, sweetly.  But she said
to herself: "I would never have believed it&mdash;Kathy Forbis
being Kathy Forbis.  But&mdash;if she is able to forget poor
Edward Yaill, even for a wonderfully-preserved example of
all the old-world virtues, with shiny jet-black curls and a
curly profile&mdash;it would be&mdash;for her, poor girl&mdash;rather a good
thing."

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
He was not in the waiting car before the guarded entrance
to the Hospital, as Katharine and Lady Wastwood gave the
pass to the sentry, and stepped forth upon the dusty metalled
road.
</p>

<p>
The car proved a large, white-enamelled Clement-Talbot of
some 22 h.p., luxuriously appointed and finished exquisitely
as a gun.  The chauffeur was a mahogany-skinned, almond-eyed
Egyptian, in a crimson felt <i>tarbûsh</i> and snow-white
silver-braided native livery.  The attendant, a grave, middle-aged
man, with long curling side-locks and olive aquiline
features,&mdash;who stood by the car door, imperturbably waiting the
arrival of the ladies, wore the plain black <i>kaftan</i> and high
black felt cap distinctive of many middle-class Jews in the
East.
</p>

<p>
The machine ran like oil along the seventeen miles of dusty
metalled roads lying between the green foliage and verdure
of Montana and the great fortified Egyptian seaport,&mdash;in its
environs of palm-groves and fig-gardens, tennis-lawns and
golf-grounds; its streets (roaring with motor-lorries;
grid-ironed with tram-lines; rattling with hack-<i>gharis</i> and <i>arabâyis</i>
full of English, French or Italians, their drivers kept from
running people over by the red-fezzed mahogany-hued Military
Police)&mdash;traversed by swinging processions of laden camels,
strings of tiny overladen donkeys, Arab hawkers, stately
veiled women with clashing silver anklets, Anglo-Egyptian
ladies in last season's Paris fashions; soldiers of the Egyptian
Army, sherbet and sweetmeat and coffee-sellers; gangs of
blue-uniformed Turkish prisoners; working-parties of the
indefatigable little men of the Egyptian Labour Corps; portly
native stockbrokers or merchants in the red <i>tarbûsh</i> and
single-breasted blue frock-coat; <i>saisis</i>, vendors of antiques made
yesterday, Dagoes and Bedwân chiefs; verminous and crazy
beggars; impish native youths and urchins pressing copies of
the <i>Alexandrian Post</i>, and the <i>Egyptian Mail</i>, <i>John Bull</i>, <i>La
Bourse</i>, the <i>Messagéro</i>, the <i>Sydney Bulletin</i> and the
<i>Palestine Gazette</i>, upon tall Australians in slouched felt hats, New
Zealanders in red-banded smashers, lean, bearded Indian
Lancers, little Ghurka Riflemen, and newly-arrived Tommies
with comparatively pink-and-white faces; respectfully lavish of
drinks and sticky native sweetmeats to veterans bronzed to the
colour of their own khaki by the suns and dust-winds of the
Desert and Palestine....
</p>

<p>
A huge, endless, living screen-picture, various and polyglot,
backed and reinforced by an infinite variety of smells....
Colours of all imaginable hues; scents and reeks, stinks and
fragrances.  The hiss and purr, the nasal whine of Oriental
tongues, mingled with the Western click and rattle, and the
clang and ring of the dominating North....  Pierced by the
all-pervading yell, for backsheesh, Backsheesh, BACKSHEESH!&mdash;the
never-ceasing slogan of the dominated East.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the crossing where the Road of the Rosetta Gate
debouches into the Rue Sherif Pasha,&mdash;whither Trixie's
inward being yearned because of the cream-puffs, pink-melon
ices, and Persian tea to be had at Groppi's Restaurant,&mdash;the
big white car swirled into the Rue el Farad, past the
beautiful tree-adorned and well-kept grounds of the Armenian
Church and School.
</p>

<p>
The thoroughfare occupies the ancient site of the Street of
the Four Winds, south of where used to be the quadruple
marble gate, the Tetrapylon, turning off the ancient Street of
the Moon.  No asphalte was here, but pavement of huge blocks
of ancient flagstone, not all cemented together, on which the
traffic of the city, the motor-lorries, hack-<i>gharis</i>,
country-carts and trains of laden small-hoofed donkeys, made an
atrocious sound....  Tall palms, overtopping the roofs of the
houses set at intervals on either side of the thoroughfare,
spoke of garden-grounds behind them....  Here and there,
built into a courtyard-wall, some chipped and broken column,
or capital of Græco-Roman carving, some incised stele of
yellowish limestone-marble, black basalt or the red granite of
Assouan, incised with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, or the
symbols of the Sun, and Moon Mother, spoke to the remoteness
of the city's antiquity....
</p>

<p>
Midway of a courtyard-wall, forbiddingly high and thickly
whitewashed, before a high closed portico having a deep
square depression on the right-hand as though a sculptured
slab or plaque had been removed from beside the entrance,
the Clement-Talbot stopped.  The heavy, green-painted door
bore, in its central compartment of white, red Hebrew lettering
instead of an Arabic inscription; the Roman numerals VII. were
on a small brass plate above the heavy metal ring
surmounting the huge clumsy lock, a lock straight out of <i>The
Arabian Nights</i>....
</p>

<p>
The grave attendant got down and opened the car.  Alighting,
Katharine and her companion passed in, over a square of
ancient mosaic, representing a black dog spotted with white,
secured by a chain attached to a scarlet collar, and displaying
a formidable mouthful of teeth.
</p>

<p>
The vestibule guarded by the mosaic dog was of yellowish
Numidian marble, yet stained a faded red in places, and
showing traces of having been divided into panels by a slender
incised ornament, partly obliterated, but recognisable as a
black caduceus wreathed with a black vine.
</p>

<p>
And the vestibule guarded by the mosaic dog was long
rather than wide, and ventilated by horizontal apertures below
the roof, filled in with metal lattice-work.  Through a similar
but larger opening overhead poured the golden sunshine of
the November noonday,&mdash;making a thick black strip of shadow
beneath the long wooden bench that ran along the right-hand
wall.  The air of the place was cool and sweet,&mdash;in spite of
an array of native shoes,&mdash;of all grades and descriptions from
jaunty red morocco with pointed turned-up toes, and heels
with sharp rims of brass or steel for the killing of snakes and
scorpions,&mdash;to venerable footgear of soiled buff or yellow
leather,&mdash;and the clumsy hide sandals commonly worn by
peasants,&mdash;ranged along the left-hand wall.  Even as she
observed the rows of shoes, Katharine's keen ears were greeted
by a curious deep-toned humming&mdash;as though innumerable,
invisible bees, of Brobdingnagian proportions&mdash;were gathering
honey from conjectural flowers in the near neighbourhood....
</p>

<p>
The negro porter who had opened the door, a huge Ethiopian
of ebony blackness, dressed and turbaned in snow-white
linen, salaamed deeply to the ladies; displaying as he did so
a mouthful of teeth as dazzling in whiteness and sharply-pointed
as those of the mosaic dog.
</p>

<p>
Then the negro shut the heavy door and locked and bolted
it.  They heard the car snort and move away as the metal
bolts scrooped in their ancient grooves of stone.  But, as they
glanced back, towards the entrance, the imperturbable
attendant in the black <i>kaftan</i> waved them forward to where
another man, exactly like himself in feature, colouring and
costume, waited as imperturbably on the threshold of a larger
hall beyond.  On its right-hand doorpost was affixed a cylinder
of metal <i>repoussée</i>, with an oval piece of glass inset&mdash;something
like a human eye.  And the big invisible bees went on
humming as industriously and as sleepily as ever:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bz'zz'z! .... Bzz'z! ... Bzz m' m'm! ...</i>"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was the bees' thick, sleepy droning that made
Miss Forbis feel as though she had previously visited this
house in a dream, in which,&mdash;though the mosaic dog had
certainly figured, together with a negro who had opened
doors,&mdash;the rows of shoes along the wall, the figure of Trixie at
her side&mdash;the two dark, ultra-respectable men in black
<i>tarbûshes</i> and <i>kaftans</i> had had no place or part.  Only John
Hazel had bulked big....  He was there,&mdash;beyond the grave
Semitic face of the second Jewish secretary&mdash;on the farther
side of the torrent of boiling amber sunshine pouring through
a central opening in the roof of the inner hall that succeeded
the vestibule of the mosaic Cerberus.  An atrium some forty
feet in length, paved with squares of black and yellow marble,
with an oblong pool in the midst of it&mdash;upon whose still,
crystal surface pink and crimson petals of roses had been
strewn in patterns,&mdash;and in the centre of which a triple-jetted
fountain played....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bzz' zz m'm! ...</i>"
</p>

<p>
The humming of the unseen bees came louder than ever,
from a doorway in the wall upon Katharine's right hand....
A wall of black polished marble, decorated with an inlaid
ornament in porphyry of yellow and red and pale green.  The
curtain of dyed and threaded reeds did not hide what lay beyond
the doorway.  You saw a long, high-pitched, whitewashed
room, cooled by big wooden electric fans working under the
ceiling, and traversed by avenues of creamy-white Chinese
matting, running between rows of low native desks; before
each of which squatted&mdash;on naked or cotton-sock-covered heels,
or sat cross-legged upon a square native chintz cushion, a
coffee-coloured, almond-eyed young Copt, in a black or blue
cotton nightgown, topped with the <i>tarbûsh</i> of black felt or a
dingy-white or olive-brown muslin turban; murmuring softly
to himself as he made entries, from right to left, in a huge
limp-covered ledger, or deftly fingered the balls of coloured
clay strung on the wires of the abacus at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! ... Wonderful!  I'm so glad you brought me!"
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood's emphatic exclamation of pleasure in her
surroundings brought cessation in the humming,&mdash;caused a
swivelling of capped or turbaned heads all down the length
of three avenues,&mdash;evoked a simultaneous flash of black
Oriental eyes, and white teeth in dusky faces lifted or turned....
Then at the upper end of the long counting-house, where
three wide glassless windows looked on a sanded palm-garden
(and the leather-topped knee-hole tables, roll-top desks, copying
ink presses, mahogany revolving-chairs, telephone installations,
willow-paper baskets, pewter inkstands and Post Office
Directories suggested Cornhill and Cheapside rather than the
Orient)&mdash;one of the olive-faced Jewish head-clerks in <i>kaftans</i>
and side-curls coughed,&mdash;and as though he had pulled a string
controlling all the observant faces,&mdash;every tooth was hidden
and every eye discreetly bent on the big limp ledgers again....
</p>

<p>
All the Coptic bees were humming sonorously in unison as
Katharine went forward to a lofty doorway, framing brightness,
where waited to receive her the master of the hive....
</p>

<p>
The light being behind him may have exaggerated his proportions,
but he seemed to Trixie the biggest man she had ever
seen, and nearly the ugliest.  Close-curling coarse black hair
capped his high-domed skull; and his stern, powerful, swarthy
face, big-nosed and long-chinned,&mdash;with a humorous quirk at
the corners of the heavy-lipped mouth that redeemed its
sensuousness&mdash;was lighted by eyes of the intensest black, burning
under heavy beetle-brows.  His khaki uniform, though of fine
material and admirable cut, was that of a common ranker, and
a narrow strip of colours over the heart, and the fact of his
left arm being bandaged and slung,&mdash;intimated to Lady Wastwood
that Katharine's Jewish friend had already served with
some degree of distinction,&mdash;and had been wounded in the War.
</p>

<p>
As he advanced to Miss Forbis, plainly unconscious of any
presence save hers, Trixie's observant green eyes saw him
bend his towering head, and sweep his right arm out and
down, with slow Oriental stateliness, bringing back the supple
hand to touch breast, lips and brow.  Whether or not he had
raised the hem of Katharine's skirt to his lips and kissed it,
Lady Wastwood could not definitely determine.  She was left
with the impression that he had done this thing.  And&mdash;as
he rose up from the deep obeisance, there sounded in her
ears these words of salutation spoken in English by a deep
voice, with the timbre and volume of an Arab war-drum:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hail!  Lady of the noble house of Philoremus Fabius.  Be
welcome to this dwelling, the cradle of your race.  Mine
to-day as my forefathers' through bygone centuries, since your
footstep crossed the threshold, we are stewards, and you are
Queen!</i>"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0308"></a></p>

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
He might have been quoting from some classical play, it
occurred to Trixie,&mdash;perhaps he was an actor, this colossal
khaki man....  Though Katharine had certainly said that he
had offices and warehouses in the city.  That was his
counting-house, that populous hall, where rows and rows of Coptic
clerks did sums in huge ledgers.  And Katharine was presenting
him as "Mr. John Hazel."  And he was saying to Lady
Wastwood, the usual civil nothings, in the voice that had the
resonance of a Somali war-gong, the deep vibration of a
Dervish battle-drum&mdash;and the clipped accent of the ordinary
middle-class Londoner.
</p>

<p>
"Frightfully glad to meet you....  Miss Forbis said she'd
bring you....  Won't you come inside?  This is my room!"
</p>

<p>
"What a room!"
</p>

<p>
The exclamation came from Lady Wastwood, but the room's
owner looked at Katharine.  The stamp of her approval was
evidently required.
</p>

<p>
"<i>You</i> like it? ..."
</p>

<p>
Katharine answered, with a long-drawn breath, in utter
sincerity:
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;Much more than like it!  It is&mdash;perfectly wonderful!"
</p>

<p>
It had probably once served as the triclinium of this ancient
Roman house.  Of spacious width, it might have been some
sixty feet in length, and twenty feet from the mosaic floor to
the frescoed ceiling, representing a sky of intense blue, with
stars of rusty gold.  Framed, the blue starry sky, in a square
of trellised roses, their hues faded and dimmed by the passage
of centuries, the yellowish marble showing in patches through
the gesso groundwork&mdash;as through that of the deep frieze
below the Attic cornice,&mdash;painted by some ancient master in the
noon of Alexandria's heyday,&mdash;and representing in hues still
fresh and brilliant the Battles of the Greeks and Amazons.
</p>

<p>
Below the frieze an ebony shelf supported a collection of
Oriental pottery and porcelain, interspersed with antique vases
and statuettes in ivory and bronze.  Down one side of the long
room were glass-doored book-cases, built in recesses,&mdash;and
cabinets stored with objects of beauty and rarity.  A wide
divan strewn with silken cushions and covered with brocade
of Damascus, ran along the opposite side and under the
window at the upper end,&mdash;where the floor&mdash;raised some eight
inches, made a kind of daïs, upon which Persian carpets of
beauty and evident value were laid....
</p>

<p>
The window, glassless, and closed at need, with delicately-carved
wooden lattices, ran across the upper end of the room,
nearly from wall to wall.  Where the window ended, a door
between twisted pillars of red and green serpentine&mdash;such as
were set between the frames of the window-lattices&mdash;led to an
open loggia, supported by slender columns.  From the window
and through the door&mdash;across the cool blue belt of shadow
made by the fluted tiled roof of the loggia&mdash;were the green
lawns and springing fountains, the groves and alleys and
shrubberies of a well-kept and spacious garden; over whose
fruit-burdened vines and fig-trees hosts of finches and orioles
and fig-birds kept up a perpetual chirping and twittering.
</p>

<p>
It was restful and cool in the wide, lofty room,&mdash;would have
been so had no wooden fans, driven by electric power&mdash;kept
the air in continual movement underneath the frescoed ceiling.
The heavy door at the hall-end being shut, the hum of
the busy Coptic bees of Hazaël &amp; Co.'s counting-house could
not penetrate, where after months of keen anticipation John
Hazel welcomed his liege lady, with outward stolidity and
grave, rather clumsy politeness&mdash;masking the shy rapture&mdash;say,
of an Eton Fourth Form boy doing the honours of his
study to the prettiest sister of his chum.
</p>

<p>
"Now, where'll you perch?" he said to Lady Wastwood,
after carefully installing Miss Forbis in the divan's right-hand
window-corner.  He was hospitable in the extreme, Trixie
decided, and any thing but well-bred.  How odd that such a
man should possess sufficient insight and discrimination to
admire Katharine as profoundly as John Hazel evidently
did....
</p>

<p>
"By the way, Mr. Hazel," Katharine's fresh voice called
to him, as he found a suitable resting-place for Lady
Wastwood&mdash;and Trixie's observant green eyes saw him jump, and
flush under his mahogany hide; "I've seen your name starred
in to-day's paper.  'Commander-in-Chief's Despatches
retelegraphed from Whitehall.  Recommended for the Military
Medal, Acting Company Sergeant John Benn Hazel&mdash;448th
City of London (Fenchurch Street) Royal Fusiliers.
Extraordinary valour displayed at Sheria....  Twelve Turks
bayonetted, one after another....'  Congratulations with all my
heart!"
</p>

<p>
Her long arm swept out to John, and he took the hand,
reddening, and promptly returned it, stammering: "Awfully
obliged for what you say!&mdash;but as regards the M.M. there's
no accounting for the way they have of ladling out these
tin-and-gilt things.  Mean well and one's obliged, but the men
who earn 'em never get 'em!"  He smote his giant palms
together, evoking a terrific detonation.  "Sorry if I made you
jump."  Nervous Trixie had done so.  "But this is how we
do in the East when we want 'em to bring tea!"
</p>

<p>
Two blue-shirted, white-gowned Egyptian boys and a bulky
middle-aged negress, black as coal; with a high silk turban of
rainbow hues, a skirted yellow over-robe, full striped trousers
of orange and green, and clashing rows of bangles, responded
to the summons, setting heavy silver trays, laden with good
things, many and various, on inlaid ebony stool-tables before
their master's guests....  The arrival of the trays heralded
the entrance of an elderly lady, sad-faced, olive-skinned,
black-eyed and white-haired, attired in an old-fashioned grey silk
gown.  As "My Aunt Esther," their big host referred to this
lady, presenting her&mdash;against all the rules of precedence, first
to Miss Forbis and inversely introducing Lady Wastwood....
With whom the sad-faced elderly lady shook hands cordially,
though she had curtseyed ceremoniously and profoundly as
she had taken the hand held out by to her by Katharine....
</p>

<p>
The tea poured out by the sad little grey lady, was Persian,
and far superior to Groppi's, in Trixie's opinion,&mdash;as were the
cream-tarts and pistachio-nut, and date-cakes,&mdash;the delicate
Egyptian rolls and creamy curls of butter, the pink-melon ices
and sherbet of fresh limes, and newly-gathered grapes, figs
and oranges....  Indifferent to the possible result of an attack
of Gippy Tummy, Trixie enjoyed herself, listening with amused
interest to Mrs. Hazaël's gentle chatter, as the little lady's
thin hands, loaded with magnificent rubies and emeralds, darted
about amongst the cups....
</p>

<p>
In fluent English, spoken with a strong French accent,&mdash;both
languages having been acquired in her girlhood, she
explained&mdash;at a Maltese Convent boarding-school, where she had
spent eight years,&mdash;she entertained her guest with arid
recollections of the Early Eighties, mingled with more welcome
details of the cost of housekeeping in the East.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that the negress,&mdash;whose name was Fatmeh, and
who came from Upper Nubia,&mdash;was responsible for the
making of the cream-tarts and the date-and-pistachio cakes....
But the crowning culinary achievement of Fatmeh was
<i>kunaféh</i>, which could not be properly offered with tea, being
a dinner-dish; made of sesame-flour, clarified butter and
honey, with eggs and raisins, and fried in a pan....  If
Miladi would honour the house by coming to dinner, the hostess
added, the <i>kunaféh</i> should be forthcoming, made and fried
in Fatmeh's finest style....
</p>

<p>
"You are quite too infinitely kind, Madame," Trixie
responded, and as she abominated pancakes, the description
of <i>kunaféh</i> left her chilly.  "But though to dine with you would
give me the greatest pleasure,&mdash;my acceptance of the invitation
must naturally depend on the engagements of Her Majesty
over there...."
</p>

<p>
And the Commandant's smiling nod indicated Miss Forbis,
seated in the divan's opposite corner, drinking Persian tea out
of exquisite porcelain, and revelling in the beauty of the
gardens,&mdash;where palms tasselled with golden fruit, and laden
fig-trees on spreading trellises, and sycamores draped with
grapevines heavy with purple clusters, made islands of shadow and
fruitful luxuriance,&mdash;while shrubberies of myrtle and rose and
oleander invited the footsteps of stranger and <i>habitué</i> to
explore the winding pathways that threaded them&mdash;under the hot
blue sky of the November noon....
</p>

<p>
"You call her Queen? ..."  The lustrous dark eyes of the
white-haired lady studied the fine face, and dwelt on the superb
lines of the gracious womanly figure for an instant before
she said: "And you are right!  <i>C'est une physionomie très
noble!</i>  I have seen Queens and Empresses in Europe&mdash;and
here in Asia, who would have looked like peasants beside
her! ... As for the arrangement of the date&mdash;that is not for me
to make&mdash;or for my nephew.  It is she who gives orders&mdash;in
this house!"
</p>

<p>
"But I thought that like myself, Miss Forbis was a stranger!
I understood from her," said Trixie munching her third
cream-cake, "that though Mr. Hazel is a great friend and pal
of hers in England, she has never visited this house before."
</p>

<p>
The reply was given with Eastern dignity:
</p>

<p>
"When I, who am fifty-eight, was a child, her father came
to Alexandria.  My grandfather, who was then living&mdash;entertained
him as a King....  His daughter has never entered the
house before,&mdash;and the house is the house of Hazaël.  But the
stones of it would call to her 'Mistress!' if the lips of Hazaël
were dumb...."
</p>

<p>
The sudden fire that had lightened in the soft dark Eastern
eyes died out of them, and the olive face resumed its sad
tranquillity.  But not before Lady Wastwood had realised a
piquant, baffling strangeness, in the relations between Kathy
Forbis and these Alexandrian Jews....
</p>

<p>
"One has one's own secrets wild horses wouldn't drag
from one," was her quaint mental comment, "and so, of
course, have others.  But mysteries and Kathy Forbis don't
seem to go together.  Why&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Trixie broke off, for at that particular juncture the huge
left hand of the little Syrian lady's big black nephew was
coolly drawn from its supporting sling, and stretched towards
a dish of fruit upon a tray that stood near.  And there came
to the Commandant's ears the full, warm voice of Katharine:
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks!  I learned to distrust green figs the first week
I spent in Egypt.  And&mdash;I think you were told yesterday at
the Hospital not to use that wounded arm! ..."
</p>

<p>
"You see, I forget," said the big man, very humbly and
apologetically.  "It's only a flesh-cut, and doesn't hurt, as I
told the Assassin-in-charge.  And I'm left-handed&mdash;like the
Hun who slashed me with his sword as he tried to pot me
with his revolver.  Has it been dressed since yesterday? ... Oh,
yes, I had to report at the General Hospital this morning,
and they looked to it all right.  And I kiboshed the C.M.O. about
my living at home.  They're fearfully crowded for space
at the General&mdash;and don't want well men blocking the
wards&mdash;luckily for me...."
</p>

<p>
He laughed, and as he stuffed his bandaged arm back into
the sling, the gleam of a ring on the third finger of his left
hand,&mdash;a great antique ring in a pale greenish gold setting,
attracted Trixie's eye.  The eye gleamed,&mdash;for a similar signet
was always worn by Katharine.  Could it be,&mdash;Oh, really!&mdash;it
couldn't&mdash;Couldn't be possible!&mdash;that Edward Yaill's
successor would be this colossal Jew....
</p>

<p>
"Of course, being a woman myself," Trixie reflected, "I
ought to be used to women having&mdash;even before the War
came to effect a fusion between the classes&mdash;such astonishing,
Extraordinary, INCOMPREHENSIBLE tastes in men!  And
naturally, after being engaged to Yaill all those years&mdash;an
officer of the old Conservative type,&mdash;thoroughbred to the
backbone, conversant with Society, high-tempered, rather
irritable, affectionate, gentle, tinged with Celtic melancholy; this
man&mdash;what is he?&mdash;must be a complete change.  Dressed
as a Territorial Tommy, living as an Alexandrian Jew
merchant, talking in the shibboleth and with the accent of the
modern City Nut,&mdash;the young man of the Theatrical Syndicate
and the West End Supper Club&mdash;dashed with something out
of the Book of Kings!  Dear me!  I'd like to shriek with
laughter&mdash;if I didn't feel nearer shedding tears of vexation at
the idea of my splendid Kathy caring for the kind of person
who says to a woman 'Where'll you perch?' when he wants
her to sit down."
</p>

<p>
Preoccupied with the absorbing theme, Trixie returned but
absent replies to Mrs. Hazaël's mild observations; and
conversation languished between the pair.  Until the
Commandant's languid attention was prodded to wakeful keenness by
a chance observation on the part of her host's aunt....
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, Miladi...."  This in reply to some reference
to the wearer of the ring similar to Katharine's.  "My
nephew John Hazaël was educated in England.  He has been
in business in the City of London&mdash;he never was in Egypt
until he came here with the English soldiers, to fight the Turk
who has driven us from our homes in Palestine!"  The sad
dark eyes lightened fiercely, the drooping figure straightened,
the toneless voice vibrated with passion as Mrs. Hazaël went
on: "Before then I had not seen my brother's son.  Indeed,
knowing him to be <i>Epikouros</i>,&mdash;I had thought of him but
little!  Imagine what for me it meant to find John Ben Hazaël
the image of his grandfather! ... For they are alike, Miladi&mdash;as
citron resembles citron,&mdash;though the years of one were a
hundred, and the other is but thirty-five.  True, he has not
learnt to observe our ancient customs, nor has he been reared
according to the Law.  He is blind to the beauty and splendour
of the glorious Hebrew religion.  But even as a myrtle in the
midst of the Desert remains a myrtle,&mdash;John Hazaël, the
eldest son of John, the son of Eli Ben Hazaël,&mdash;will live the
life and die the death of a good, believing Jew!"
</p>

<p>
"To know that," Trixie returned, conscious of feeling her
way amidst unseen pitfalls, "must be a great pleasure to you,
Madame...."
</p>

<p>
"I do not look for pleasure," came the sad-toned answer.
"And comfort there is none for me, whom the Turk has
stripped of all.  When this terrible War broke out in Palestine,
Miladi, I had a husband,&mdash;and two sons,&mdash;and a daughter!"&mdash;A
convulsion rippled under the olive skin of the withered
face as the waters of a lonely forest-pool will stir on a
windless day....  "My son Jacob they took first,&mdash;to labour with
the road-gangs between Sailed and Tiberias....  My
daughter&mdash;my Esther, my darling and my treasure&mdash;the golden joy
of her father's heart&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Pray, pray, do not tell me!" Lady Wastwood whispered
entreatingly, for the speaker's dark eyes were bloodshot and
her mouth had twisted in the involuntary grimace of weeping
with difficulty restrained, "I can guess something terrible....
Please believe that I deeply feel for you!&mdash;I who have lost
husband and children too! ..."
</p>

<p>
"'Husband and children! ...'  <i>Achi nebbich!</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
The little grey woman bowed her lace-draped head, and
folded her jewelled hands in her grey silk lap as she
continued:
</p>

<p>
"But such deaths were those of my loved ones, Miladi, that
nothing that you could imagine could approach the terror of
the truth!  Yet it might have been worse&mdash;oh, infinitely!&mdash;had
not Jacob possessed the courage of a lion.  He shot his
sister, Miladi, in the room of her destroyer,&mdash;and turned the
pistol on himself and died also! ..."  There was a clang of
pride in the dull tear-soaked voice.  "Then Reuben Ben
Ephraim&mdash;who was with Jacob in the den of the hyena&mdash;Hamid
Bey Effendi&mdash;Commander of the Turkish soldiers at
Nazareth"&mdash;there followed some rapid guttural words in a
tongue unknown to Trixie, probably a bitter Hebrew curse
upon the hated name....  "then Reuben, seeing both dead,
escaped by the Mercy, and sent word to us, me and my
husband&mdash;in our house near Jaffa&mdash;of what had befallen the
children of our love! ... And hearing that the vengeance of
Hamid was to be wreaked upon us, my husband Isaac, the
uncle of John Hazaël! ... may Peace be upon him! as it is
our custom to say&mdash;Isaac escaped to Beirut with our last
child, Benjamin.  Miladi&mdash;the fierce wolves seized them.
They both died in prison at Beirut&mdash;under the Turkish
rods! ... The young child first, Miladi&mdash;under the eyes of his
father....  Then the father!&mdash;Peace be upon them both! ... And
the shock of the news killed Eli Ben Hazaël, for he was
close upon a hundred....  Thus am I widow, and childless,
and fatherless in this house that has sheltered my people for
more than sixteen centuries.  Ah, Miladi!&mdash;I have made you
weep! ... I have no tears&mdash;they were all shed long ago!"  She
rose, a little tragic figure in her old-fashioned silk gown,
and held out to Trixie a withered, jewelled hand.  "My nephew
is looking at me....  He wishes me to show you the garden,
while he speaks of business with Mademoiselle Forbis...."  A
slight cry escaped her as her eyes went to the window, and a
faint gleam of pleasure lightened in their hopelessness as she
lifted the wasted, glittering hand: "See!  O see!  Look,
Miladi! ... Look, my children! ... Once again, the swallows have
come! ..."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There had been no swallows a moment previously.  Summer
in the North, warmer that year of 1917 than in the three
preceding, had delayed their autumn journey overseas.  Now the
deep blue sky above the tamarisk and acacia Nilotica,&mdash;the
vine-draped sycamore figs, the tall imperial palm-trees, the
orange and lemon groves, and the myrtle and rose-thickets
behind the house in the Rue el Farad, were crossed and
recrossed by innumerable downy black-and-white bodies, borne
upon darting, quivering pinions, and the continuous twitterings
of the fig-birds were drowned by their shrill squeaks....
</p>

<p>
From the eaves of the round-tiled roof of the loggia, where
some old nests were yet remaining, a rope of swallows swayed
and dangled; clinging one to the tail of another&mdash;the weight of
the whole rope sustained by the first usurper of the disputed
nest....  A moment more and the feathered rope resolved
into its original atoms.  They rose in a cloud,&mdash;squealing,
wheeling, hovering and poising, and launched themselves in
joyous chase of the flies and mosquitoes, whose deadliest
enemies they are....
</p>

<p>
And then one of the darting things&mdash;possibly a new-fledged
stranger&mdash;keen on the capture of some gauze-winged morsel,
flew in at the window, and hawked about the room....
</p>

<p>
The blue sky frescoed on the ceiling by the ancient artist,
framed in its trellis of dimmed and faded roses, must have
deceived the eager bird.  Its upward flight ended in the tiniest
thud possible....  Vitality quitted its infinitesimal being....
It dropped, a mere puff of black and white feathers, at
Katharine Forbis's feet....
</p>

<p>
"Again....  Each year, the same thing happens!  A bird is
killed&mdash;just in this way.  It is sad, but there's no help for
it...." sighed Mrs. Hazaël.  "Throw it away, dear
Mademoiselle, it is only a dead bird! ..."
</p>

<p>
But Mademoiselle, who had picked up the tiny body to
cherish and croon over, did not follow her hostess's advice.  To
sense the divine quality of maternity inherent in Katharine's
beauty, you had to see her petting an invalid, or a child.  Or
as now, with some helpless, injured creature,&mdash;looking at it
under drooped eyelids of soft solicitude, cherishing it with
compassionate touches of deft, womanly hands....
</p>

<p>
Those kind hands had touched John Hazel, yesterday, in
helping the Hospital surgeon and Sister with the dressing of
his wounded arm....  It was not until their contact had sent
shocks of keen, scarce bearable delight thrilling through nerve
and tissue, that John Hazel had discovered&mdash;what you have
guessed ere now....
</p>

<p>
All the night through he had lain awake, living those
moments over, and over!&mdash;cursing himself for a fool thrice
soaked in folly, a bally idiot, and a presumptuous cad....
But daylight had found him no whit more wise, nor one iota
less besotted; even more gnawed with desperate hunger to feel
her cool breath fanning his bared shoulder, and know the
rapture of her touch again....
</p>

<p>
Now the soft, compassionate eyes, the tender touch and the
sweet solicitude were given to a bird, while the man hungered.
John Hazel, one is compelled to own&mdash;was keenly jealous of
the stunned swallow&mdash;as the thorn-like beak opened and shut,
and the sealed eyelids quivered apart&mdash;and Katharine's cry of
womanly joy greeted these signs of life....
</p>

<p>
"It isn't dead, dear Madame!" she cried gaily to the Syrian
lady, as she dipped a finger-tip in a flower-vase that stood
near, dropped some water in the open beak, and wetted the
velvety head....  The swallow quivered in her palm, gasped
convulsively and swallowed the water; swallowed another
drop given in the same way, and regaining strength, struggled
to free itself from the protecting hand....
</p>

<p>
"Kiss it, Trixie, and give it a message for its little
brothers! ...  Now you shall go, my dear," said Katharine, when,
Lady Wastwood having dutifully kissed the top of the bird's
head, she touched the featherless, velvet crown with her own
lips.  Then, still cherishing the struggling bird in her cupped
palms, she passed through the door at the head of the divan,
stepped out upon the loggia, and with a sweep of her long arm,
sent the captive, squeaking with rapture, to rejoin its
long-winged comrades in the playgrounds of the air.
</p>

<p>
"How's that, Umpire?" she called to John Hazel, following
with attentive eyes the rocket-like upward rush.  "It rather sets
one thinking"&mdash;she broke off in the middle of the sentence as
John stooped beneath the lintel of the doorway, and joined
her on the loggia.
</p>

<p>
"Thinking of what?" he asked, for her face was grave and
troubled.
</p>

<p>
"Of prisoners and captives," Katharine answered, "and what
they must feel when their fetters are broken and their dungeons
lie behind them, and the free sky is over them and the
free earth underfoot....  Talking of earth, I rather think you
promised to show me your garden, or if you didn't I should like
you to....  Your aunt has spirited Lady Wastwood away&mdash;"  She
nodded at Trixie's tall, thin retreating shape, upright and
workmanlike in its badged, light-weight smasher hat and
short-skirted khaki cotton-drill uniform; as side by side with
Mrs. Hazaël's black lace mantilla and old-fashioned trailing grey
silk gown, it turned the corner of a myrtle-hedge, and was
lost in the shrubbery.  "And I rather want to consult you....
There's a seat under that moss-cup oak&mdash;it is a moss-cup,
isn't it?&mdash;it's getting beautifully cool, and the tree looks nice
and shady.  And you could smoke&mdash;or I could&mdash;and talk
comfortably there...."
</p>

<p>
He got her green-lined sun-umbrella and insisted on holding
it over her, as they crossed the verdant, well-watered lawn
to the patriarchal moss-cup oak of Miss Forbis's desire.  A
curve-backed, scroll-ended seat of red granite stood under its
wide-spreading branches.  Near the seat was a great bed of
balsam and heliotrope.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sweet, sweet!"  He had gathered a huge handful of
the fragrant-flowered, nettle-leaved plant and laid it on
Katharine's knee as she seated herself, and her sentences were broken
with rapturous sniffs.  "How I&mdash;do&mdash;love&mdash;the smell of
heliotrope! ... I thought it heavenly in England,&mdash;but it was
nothing to this! ... And the view of the house from where I
sit! ... Who would have dreamed that behind the hideous
whitewashed wall of your courtyard, so much of the wonderful
lost city of Alexander the Great, and of the Ptolemies, in
whose Museum Euclid and Aristophanes, and Hypatia were
Professors,&mdash;lay snugly tucked away!"  She went on wistfully:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me why I feel as though my heartstrings were tangled
up in the foundations of this dear, dear house of yours, and
there were memories and voices in the stones of the
walls! ... Why don't you smoke? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I will if I may....  It'll keep off the mosquitoes.  May I
offer you one?"  He produced a case.
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks!  I'll smoke mine.  Yours look good, but too
large and solid for feminine creatures to appreciate.  Though
when I worked at the Front in France, I've been glad to fall
back on Army Gaspers.  Or ten <i>sou</i> packets of the rank Régie
beloved by the Poilu."
</p>

<p>
"You used to smoke before the War?"  He asked it as he
gave her a light, and she answered, as the Turkish tobacco
kindled, breathing out a delicate puff of the fragrant bluish
vapour:
</p>

<p>
"After a luncheon or dinner-party, one smoked&mdash;just to keep
other people in countenance.  But afterwards&mdash;in France&mdash;and
here, to quiet one's jangled nerves!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't look like a woman with jangled nerves," he said,
considering her steadily.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not, but still they play up sometimes....  Look at
the swallows&mdash;they've already begun to build!  In the corner
of the window of that big upper room with three large
windows latticed up, and groups of columns between them&mdash;and
a dome, rising behind the pediment&mdash;it is a pediment, isn't it?
that long triangular stone? ..."
</p>

<p>
The deep voice said to her:
</p>

<p>
"No one ever uses that room where you see the swallows
building.  It is kept locked all through the year except on one
day...."  The great brown hand pointed to the three windows
below the pediment, the deep voice so like and so unlike
John Hazel's went on: "There is an altar in that room with a
Christian shrine beneath it....  We strip the gardens bare
each year to make the chapel beautiful,&mdash;we who have been
Guardians of the Shrine for more than sixteen hundred
years...."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but this is a Jewish house! ..."
</p>

<p>
"That is quite true."  The brown hand waved.  "The house
belongs to Jews indeed, but it was not theirs always....
Nor do we break the Jewish Law in honouring the dead.
Should you, who are of his race and faith, desire to visit the
chapel ... here is the key....  Whenever you will, I am
ready to take you there."
</p>

</h3>

<p>
He rose, and took from his pocket, and held out to Miss
Forbis, a flat metal spatula of Eastern make, attached to a
silver chain.  She looked from the clumsy object in the big
brown hand to the grave face above it, whose dense black eyes
had a reddish glow; and saw that his temples and blue-shaven
upper-lip and jaws glistened with points of moisture, though
the sun had but the tempered heat of these first days of
November, and a sea-breeze coming out of the West whispered among
the leaves.
</p>

<p>
"How am I of his race?" she asked, after a moment's
hesitation.  "Please be good enough to keep the key....  One of
these days I may muster curiosity to visit the shrine in the
chapel.  Just now, to tell the truth, I want more to talk to you.
I've put it off, as one does dodge sorrowful things, but now
I've got to tell you...."  Her voice wavered and her lips
were tremulous.  "It has to do with the letter you brought me
from Palestine...."
</p>

<p>
"I am quite as anxious to hear as you are to tell me.  But
first, Miss Forbis, you must visit the shrine in the chapel.
You ought to have gone there before, but you wished to see
the garden, and your wish is a command here,&mdash;I could only
obey!  But now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He offered her the clumsy key, coolly and imperturbably.
There was incredulity in her tone, as she inquired:
</p>

<p>
"You don't mean that I must go, whether I wish it or do
not?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry to coerce you," he said with stern distinctness.
"You must understand that.  But, before we hear the Sunset
Call to Prayer from the Mosque of Sidi Amr, it is necessary
that you should visit the shrine.  Understand me&mdash;it is
incumbent upon you as the representative of your family.  You
have to!"
</p>

<p>
"'Have to! ...'"
</p>

<p>
She rose to her feet, and her angry eyes swept over him
contemptuously.  To be ordered about by this man was
intolerable&mdash;absurd....  They faced each other, and the old gulf
opened and yawned between them&mdash;as it had in the drawing-room
at Kerr's Arbour, eight months before.
</p>

<p>
"'Have to!' ... You rather forget yourself, don't you,
Mr. Hazel? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I do what is my duty in enforcing respect to <i>him</i>!"
</p>

<p>
He drew himself to his towering height, folded his great
arms, and looked at her calmly.
</p>

<p>
He spoke again, and the profound tones vibrated through
her, like the sound of a Buddhist temple-bell....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Through the centuries since he died for the Faith of the
Nazarene, Christian priests have blessed his ashes on one day
in every year.  Not even when Alexandria lay in cinders and
ruin, was there lacking a son of the Hazaël to guard his relics
here.  But since Marcus Fabius the Tribune came here on
his way to Britain with the Tenth Legion of Constantine,&mdash;and
the son of Marcus, Florens Fabius&mdash;journeyed from Rome
twenty years later,&mdash;and the Crusaders Fulk and Hew came
eleven hundred and sixty years after, and Bishop Ralph in
1809, and Philip in 1881, to kneel before his shrine; no heart
filled with his blood has beaten in the lonely chamber, no lips
warm with his life have touched the chilly stone.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The clang of the great voice ceased to oppress her sense of
hearing.  She bent her noble head in splendid humility, a
great lady, rebuked by the descendant of an Hebrew steward,
and said:
</p>

<p>
"You have reproached me very justly.  My only excuse
is&mdash;that I did not understand!"
</p>

<p>
He went with her across the lawn, and ushered her through
the loggia door into a passage, and up a wide staircase leading
by one short flight of steps to the single floor above.  She took
the curious Eastern key he silently offered her, and put it in
the lock of the door he had stopped at.  The lock yielded
easily....
</p>

<p>
"Won't&mdash;won't you come too?" she whispered, oppressed
with an increasing sense of awe, and John Hazel's voice
answered from behind her:
</p>

<p>
"We are the Guardians of the Shrine, and yet we may not
enter.  It would not be according to the Law!"
</p>

<p>
Thus Katharine went in alone, her heart-beats quickened
by the startled whirr of wings, as the busy swallows quitted
their nest-building in the upper corner of one of the three tall
windows, filled in with lattices of carved and painted marble,
and looking on the garden, now all golden in the rays of the
westering sun.
</p>

<p>
The ceiling rose to a frescoed dome, with an opening at the
apex.  The spice of incense and the perfume of flowers yet
sweetened the still air of this place of memories.  It was a
revelation of wonderful art, its dome and walls covered with
ancient frescoes, representing in all the opulent symbolism of
early Christianity, the anchor, the palm, the Dove with the
olive-branch; the Vine, the heavy ear of Wheat, the Fish, the
Chalice encircled with rays of glory,&mdash;the Good Shepherd
carrying His lamb.  The carved and inwrought and costly
screens of cedar and ebony-wood were all inlaid in mother o'
pearl, silver and ivory.  Nothing had been spared in money or
labour, to perfect this&mdash;the replica in miniature, of the interior
of a Coptic Christian Church.  Save that seemly, exquisite
neatness, and scrupulous cleanliness reigned here instead of
dust and dirt, spider-webs, and bird and bat-droppings; and
the disquieting disorder which too often, in the East, prevails
in such a sacred place....
</p>

<p>
Katharine passed over the mosaic floor of red and green
porphyry and grey crystalline syenite, and through the central
opening in the latticed outer screen.  The gates stood open,
showing an altar, wrought of black Egyptian basalt, standing
under a baldaquin of inlaid ebony-wood borne on four carved
and inlaid columns, the rich embroidered curtains of the
baldaquin being drawn back.  Four man-high candlesticks of
silver, holding great unlighted tapers, were set one at each
corner of the basalt altar.  On the altar was an upper covering
of rich silk, embroidered with gold.  On this were a censer
of silver open-work, a silver-gilt or golden incense-box, and
two golden candlesticks of magnificent workmanship flanked
the usual copy of the Four Gospels, sealed in a gold and
jewelled case.
</p>

<p>
Three silver lamps hung before the altar.  In the central
lamp alone burned a tiny votive flame.  The altar was not
raised above the floor....  Its front was uncovered, and a
small square opening in this resembled a doorway.
</p>

<p>
In the cavity revealed by the opening stood an alabaster urn
of funerary type and evidently of great antiquity.  Katharine,
kneeling on the upper step of the little sanctuary, could, despite
the tempering of the light by the screens and window-lattices,
clearly distinguish below the Greek monogram of the Sacred
Name, in irregular lines of incised Roman capitals,&mdash;still
rusty-bright with antique gilding,&mdash;the epitaph in faulty Latin:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
  "MARTYR CHRISTI, AMICVSPAVPERVM.<br>

<p>
Katharine Forbis came out of the chapel, noiselessly shutting
the door behind her, and stood, looking silently down at a man
who knelt there.  He raised the head that had been bowed
nearly to the floor, and rose to his feet at the sound of her
footstep, removed his cap, and, standing aside made room
for Miss Forbis to pass him before he re-locked the door.
Then he followed her downstairs, through the passage and
doorway leading to the loggia, and back into the garden they
had left....
</p>

<p>
Copts with tied-back sleeves and tucked-up <i>gelabiyehs</i> were
moving among the flower-beds with wheeled tanks and syringes,
setting water running in the channels bordering the paths of
the rose-alleys and shrubberies.  Already the perfume exhaled
from wet rich soil and dampened petals freshened the air,
and the sultry heat had abated.  Coolness was coming with
the short Eastern twilight, the sky above, and to the west, was
streaked with pomegranate and amber; the elongated shadow
of the house, with its dome and pediment and flat loggiaed
roofs, stretched dusky-blue over the grass to the foot of the
red granite seat under the moss-cup oak.
</p>

<p>
Katharine's heliotropes were lying on the seat, faded already
but still exhaling sweetness....  As she lifted them from the
hot red stone, the faint south breeze brought to her across the
crowded buildings, and the traffic of Khedive street, the mellow
voice of a muezzin from the minaret of the Mosque Sidi Amr,
crying, as it cries thrice a day, from thousands of minarets
in four world-continents:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Allah is most great!  I witness that there is no God but
Allah!  And Mohammed is the apostle of Allah!  Come to
prayer!  Prayer is better than work!  Come to salvation!  God
is most great!  There is no God but Allah!</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When the voice from the mosque, and its myriad human
echoes had vibrated into silence, and the distant noise of
the crowded streets had rolled back into hearing again,&mdash;Katharine
said to the man who stood silently beside her, his khaki
cap dangling from his big right hand:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hazel, you have to forgive in me an indifference that
may have wounded you.  But until I found myself in that
chapel, in the presence of the reliquary urn that speaks of his
martyrdom, my ancestor was no more to me than a legendary
old Roman, who lived and died in a remote Past, in a distant
part of the world.  But since I said a prayer for him before
that altar, it was&mdash;as though he had only died a month or two
ago! ... Now, it crushes me to realise that through more
than sixteen centuries, you and yours have guarded those
ashes in the urn! ..."
</p>

<p>
"It is true.  Since the forefather of Ephraim&mdash;you have seen
Ephraim&mdash;it was he who attended you here from Montana&mdash;brought
back the ring to Alexandria, and the widow opened
the sealed packet&mdash;the wishes of the Founder of the House
of Hazaël have scrupulously been carried out.  There has
always been a Christian hand to clean the lamp and feed it
with oil daily, and place fresh flowers in the vases on one
day in the year....  Though I have heard that in the days of
the Great Earthquake&mdash;when fifty thousand people perished
in the fire or were buried beneath the ruins,&mdash;there was no
oil for the famine that then prevailed...."
</p>

<p>
The deep monotonous voice that spoke in somewhat archaic
English&mdash;was and was not the voice of John Hazel....  And
suddenly, with a shudder and a crisping of the nerves as she
looked at and listened to him,&mdash;Katharine doubted whether
he realised that he was speaking at all....
</p>

<p>
"Chosroes the Persian King," the deep voice went on, "laid
siege to the city,&mdash;and the Arab Amru, general of Omar's
Saracen armies,&mdash;wrested it from the Persians and held it:&mdash;but
before the urn,&mdash;hidden in a secret chamber of this dwelling,
the votive lamp burned still!  And as a weaker hawk by
suddenness snatches a quail from a hawk that is by far the
stronger&mdash;and as the stronger pursues and wrests it from the
first, even so the Greeks took Alexandria by cunning from the
Saracens&mdash;and the Saracens won her back again&mdash;yet the lamp
went on burning, for the hands that tended it were faithful,
and the children of Hazaël's children's children were sedulous
to do his will.  Then in the Fourteenth Century of your
Christian Era came the Crusaders and sacked and spoiled
the city.  But the lamp was not quenched even then! ... Nor
when the French seized Alexandria&mdash;nor when the British
took and held it&mdash;nor when they ceded it to Mehmet Ali&mdash;did
the lamp cease to burn....  Jewish oil is very good, and
Jewish hearts remember!  The Past is living as the Present in the
mind of the Jew.  The negress whom you saw to-day, and her
husband Zaid, are Christians.  It is they who are entrusted&mdash;like
their forerunners, with the keeping of the place...."
</p>

<p>
His tone changed.  He spoke now in his own clipped and
slangy vernacular.
</p>

<p>
"By the way&mdash;I want to say&mdash;with reference to the apology
you were&mdash;so&mdash;gracious as to offer me, that I think it was
awfully ripping of you!  But for a thing I said, a bit back,
that rather rattled you....  <i>I</i> don't apologise at all! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Dear John Hazel, I haven't even asked you!"  In her frank,
womanly, impulsive way, she stretched out a hand and lightly
pressed his.  "I have learned from you the priceless worth of
Jewish loyalty and Jewish honour;&mdash;and a devotion for which
I don't know even how to begin to express my gratitude and
esteem!  Unless in some way like this&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He started, and his dark hand clenched; for carried away
by an irresistible impulse, Miss Forbis had bent aside and
brushed it lightly with her lips.  The instant the impulse had
had its way she realised her mistake....  For the man's great
frame quivered from head to foot as though the ague fit of
fever were upon him....  He mastered the trembling with an
effort that left him rigid; and said,&mdash;his face yet stiffly averted
and his black eyes bent upon the ground:
</p>

<p>
"You asked me a good many months ago,&mdash;I don't mistake&mdash;for
I remember everything you've ever said to me!&mdash;if I
thought that you and I had ever lived on earth before now?"  He
went on as she bent her head, sensing the movement rather
than seeing it.  "What I said then, I say again! ... I don't
believe either of us is by way of making a second visit to this
little old planet....  But somehow we are influenced by those
who have passed on!  Not by the hanky-panky, table-rapping,
automatic pencil-scribbling Spooklets you summon up as with
your thumbs crossed,&mdash;points downwards&mdash;and your little
fingers jammed against those of your right-and-left hand
neighbours,&mdash;you sit round a rubber-covered table in a stuffy,
darkened room....  Spirits of dead poets who've forgotten how
to turn a rhyme!&mdash;dead historians who mix up Alexander
the Great with Napoleon the Little&mdash;and perpetrate
howlers that would disgrace a Fourth Standard Board School
kid....  Dead Editors who can't spell for peanuts....  And
dead chemists who're knocked out by the formula of H2O!"
</p>

<p>
He moved behind the seat and sat on the other end of it,
crossing his long legs, slipping his left arm from the sling, and
nursing a big-boned knee in both powerful hands as he went on:
</p>

<p>
"Put it that those who carried in their blood the germs
that you and I have sprung from&mdash;living on the Other Side as
conscious Intelligences,&mdash;are permitted by the Divine Power
Who rules things visible and invisible,&mdash;to sway us, help us,
prompt our actions, check our impulses and desires&mdash;and you
have what I believe, concentrated down to tabloid form!  On
the whole, your Catholic faith in Guardian Angels isn't much
unlike it.  Only, instead of a bright-winged spirit hovering
somewhere near me, I've felt as though a big old man, dark
and strong, like my father,&mdash;was keeping his eye on me....
And the bias of the lead he gave,&mdash;quite definite when you
shut your eyes&mdash;and felt back in the dark of your mind along
the spider-thread that led to him,&mdash;was definitely for Right
and clearly opposed to Wrong! ..."
</p>

<p>
Hugging his knee, he looked for the first time directly at
Katharine, since that swift incautious touch of her lips had
levelled the last barrier, and turned his blood to flame.  There
was no shamed consciousness in the pure eyes that met his....
She listened, and his thoughts were mirrored in the swift
changes of her face....
</p>

<p>
"I didn't shape out this theory of mine, till I was getting
close on thirty.  I'd lived all my life amongst Christians and
Jews who faithfully believed in Nothing!&mdash;and what one saw,
and touched and tasted was quite enough for them and for
me!  That I ran anything but straight, there's not the least
earthly use denying...."  His memory went back to Birdie
Bright, and others of her liberal sisterhood, and a dusky flush
burned under his tawny, sun-baked skin.  "But when the
War broke out, and I joined the London Terriers&mdash;and saw
men dying in the mud of France and Flanders, as up to date
I'm seeing 'em die in the dirt of Palestine!&mdash;the advantage
of living clean and being ready to answer to one's number came
home to me as it never had before....  And Life was sweet,
because it was so damnably uncertain! ... Men dealt Death
every hour to the son of some mother, and no one could have
guessed when it mightn't be his turn!  Fellows used to tell me
I killed men as if I liked doing it!&mdash;and I'm bound to
admit I did! ... They said I sang as I fought,&mdash;in Hebrew
one learned bloke swore it was!  Though, as I hardly knew a
word,&mdash;it couldn't have been the truth.  But this is true, that
in the blinding thick of the scrap I'd feel that big man near
me....  I've seen him&mdash;or as good as!&mdash;signing and waving
me on....  And when I came back to Hospital, and got that
letter from Jaffa, and took over the Title Deeds, and the
Guardianship of the Ashes; and put on the onyx signet-ring&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then?"  Her clear eyes were intent upon him....
</p>

<p>
"Then, instead of one old man, big and dark and
brawny, strangely dressed&mdash;standing somewhere back of me,
grimly willing me on; I seemed to be&mdash;I seem now!&mdash;to be
looking back through Time down an interminable line of such
men....  And the biggest of all the big old men is right away
at the end! ... That's all! ..."  He put down the knee he
had nursed.
</p>

<p>
"We Catholics believe that the souls of our dead love us
and pray for us; and by Our Lord's permission&mdash;may sometimes
help us in need.  Do you think&mdash;do not answer unless
you wish!&mdash;that he&mdash;your Big Old Man&mdash;ever suggests
answers to you? ... Or prompts you with knowledge having
reference to bygone matters? ... Forgotten, old, long-buried
things, of which you could not otherwise know? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I think&mdash;"  He turned his face to Katherine, and it was
no longer stern and grim, but wore the toothy, cheerful grin
of Private Abrahams&mdash;"that sometimes that Biggest Old Man
of All is quite close to me.  Towering up over my head, and
sticking out all around me!  And the thing he wants I've got to
do, and the line he points I follow.  And have to until Kingdom
Come, and All the Rest, Amen! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Is he huge and tawny-brown with coarse curls of jet-black
hair&mdash;and a great beard&mdash;and a fillet of white leather, set with
green stones&mdash;round his forehead? ... Has he a face much
like yours, but stern as Destiny? ... Is he wrapped in a great
black mantle with a hood like a Dominican's?  Does he wear
immense thigh-boots and carry an iron-shod staff? ..."
</p>

<p>
The memory of her dream, months back at Kerr's Arbour,
had prompted Katharine's question.  John Hazel turned and
looked at her in utter amaze.
</p>

<p>
"That's how <i>I</i> see him, but how do <i>you</i> come to know? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know,&mdash;but I saw a man like that in a dream,
once....  I seemed to be in danger, threatened by evil beings,
and he came to the rescue.  That's absolutely all!  But, let
me out of the depth of my own ignorance, give you a word of
warning.  This strange gift of yours ought to be held
reverently.  Kept a profound secret, and never under any
circumstance? whatever submitted to a stranger's control.  You
understand?"
</p>

<p>
"All right!  I'll be wide&mdash;O!"  His black eyes snapped as he
answered, and she went on:
</p>

<p>
"Now to come back to usual things, look at this flower, and
tell me whether you know it?"  She was holding out to him
a withered spike of multifold white blossoms, exhaling a faint
and delicate smell:
</p>

<p>
"That lily-thing...."  He took it carefully in his big
fingers.  "All through October it was blooming in Palestine.
Acres and acres of it&mdash;all white and yellow&mdash;when I left the
Front to come down here.  Smells nice!"  He sniffed at it
cautiously.  "Something between a West End church got up
for a Society wedding,&mdash;and the hall of a house blocked up
with florist's boxes&mdash;where there's going to be a first-class
funeral....  Presently, when the Spring comes along, there'll
be scarlet tulips, and rose and purple anemones, and pink-and-white
turncap lilies, and flowers I couldn't as much as name
to you&mdash;miles and miles of 'em swarming over the plains, and
covering the knees of those old Judæan Hills.  The name
of this is asphodel.  I forget who told me!  Where did you
get it? ... I haven't seen it here! ..."
</p>

<p>
"It came in the letter you brought me from Palestine...."  She
took back the withered flower and slipped it back within
her blouse.  His eyes followed it, and she went on: "It is of the
letter I wanted particularly to speak to you.  For it tells me
that Julian&mdash;my brother&mdash;is alive! ..."
</p>

<p>
"And a prisoner! ..."  He spoke with certainty....
</p>

<p>
"And a prisoner at a Turkish labour-camp!"
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do? ..."
</p>

<p>
Her bosom heaved in a perplexed sigh.  Her broad brows
knitted, and her clear eyes were clouded as she turned them
upon John:
</p>

<p>
"Move Heaven and earth in any way possible to get my
poor boy out of that earthly hell!  Meanwhile one must wait,
I suppose&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Does it strike you as a case likely to benefit by waiting?"
</p>

<p>
"No!&mdash;and in spite of that there is nothing to do but wait.
Unless&mdash;unless you, who were so prompt to help in those
troubled days at Kerr's Arbour, could suggest any&mdash;definite
plan of action to me now? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do my best, you may be sure!"
</p>

<p>
"I know you will," she responded gratefully.  "But first I
must put you in possession of the facts.  Julian&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is at Shechem....  I know it already....  No!"  For
her eyes had cried out to him "Edward! ..."  "From another
informant than Colonel Yaill.  The airman who brought me
here,&mdash;an Egyptian reconnaissance-officer I met at
Salonika&mdash;happens to be on special duty at the Palestine Front just
now....  Wing-Major Essenian Pasha....  Perhaps you've heard
the name? ..."
</p>

<p>
She thought, and answered:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have often seen it mentioned in Despatches, in association
with feats of aviation; bombing-raids carried out single-handed
for the most part; dazzling reconnaissances over strongholds
held by the enemy...."
</p>

<p>
"That's my man.  'A vivid personality,' my mother'd have
ticketed him....  He was an officer of the Khedive's Artillery
in prehistoric ages&mdash;at the time of the Egyptian Army Revolt
under Arabi Pasha.  That was about 1881.  And he was with
Hicks Pasha's Expedition in 1883&mdash;against the Mahdi&mdash;which
got wiped out by the Baggara near El Obeyd....  He had a
command under Baker Pasha in 1884, and was with the
Dongola Relief Advance,&mdash;and with the Khartoum Column in
1897 ... Emin Pasha was a pal of his&mdash;and Gordon thought
no end of him....  When the South African War of 1900
broke out he'd retired&mdash;was living at Ismailia&mdash;as a wealthy
Egyptian ex-officer of Engineers....  Took up aviation and
started a Flying Club here in Alexandria about 1911....
Gave the Club an aërodrome&mdash;with hangars and everything!&mdash;the
big place you've seen near the Water Works,&mdash;and another
at Ismailia where he lives&mdash;and another on the Upper
Nile! ... And as he flies like Satan, the Government snapped at
him, when he volunteered for the Royal Flying Corps in
1914...."
</p>

<p>
"He must be a brave man! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Got nerve enough for anything! ... And to look at him
you'd guess him to be thirty-five as the limit....  Yet there
are old men here in Alexandria who've known him since they
were gay young Johnnies,&mdash;and they're ready to bet their wigs
and false teeth that he's always been the same! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Could Essenian Pasha be of use in this particular
emergency? ..."
</p>

<p>
"You mean your brother's case? ... He had the facts
from me at Salonika....  I said the brother of a friend of
mine&mdash;a Chaplain serving with the Expeditionary&mdash;was missing
since the storming of Scimitar Hill and supposed to have
been killed....  And I mentioned his being a Catholic priest,
and added his name, and a few particulars.  For instance, I'd
heard from the landlady at the <i>Cross Keys</i>, Cauldstanes,
months ago, that Father Forbis was very handsome.  'As like
oor Miss Forbis as gin they were twins'&mdash;I can't do her Scotch
for peanuts, 'but blue-eyed and wi' fair hair.'"
</p>

<p>
"It is true.  Except about us being so much alike," she said,
her eyes now openly brimming over.  "For Julian has almost
the beauty of an angel, and when he sings, the voice of one.
My father worshipped him....  So did Mark&mdash;and I for that
matter! ... So did the priests and the students at the
Seminary, the Prior and the Fathers at the Monastery, and the
officers and men of the Brigade with which he served....
You should see the letters they wrote me when his death was
reported.  And now!&mdash;Don't be scared!&mdash;I'm not going to
cry."
</p>

<p>
She brought out a little filmy handkerchief and dried the
tears bravely, and put it away again....
</p>

<p>
"Crying isn't of any use.  Forget that I was stupid enough
to shed tears!&mdash;they are over and done with now.  Tell me
how your friend of the R.F.C. could help us in this strait?"
</p>

<p>
John Hazel hugged his knee again, and said, with knitted
eyebrows:
</p>

<p>
"You mean, how I think, and he believes, he could help
us,&mdash;since he dropped down in our lines the day after Sheria.
He'd been doing a lot of reconnaissance over Hebron and
Shechem, and a shell from a Turkish A.A. had burst near
them&mdash;and Captain Usborn of the Engineers, his observer&mdash;was
lying over, stone-dead&mdash;behind his Lewis gun....  Shot
through the head.  See&mdash;this is the bullet that did it!"  He
slipped two fingers inside a front-pocket of his tunic, drew out
and showed her the dented cone of lead....
</p>

<p>
"Isn't that," her fine brows frowned, "rather a gruesome
relic to carry? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know!&mdash;that's as you happen to look at it.  I
wasn't out for mascots&mdash;the thing came my way, and so I
just froze on....  And"&mdash;he dropped the bullet back again,
"then Major Essenian Pasha sent for me, and asked me&mdash;I'd
flown with him several times near Salonika&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
John Hazel spoke in a low voice calculated just to reach
her ear:
</p>

<p>
"He asked me whether I'd replace Usborn on the flight
back to Ismailia,&mdash;if permission could be wrested from the
Powers that Be? ... Then he went on to tell me of something
he'd got from an Arab, with reference to a British
prisoner in the labour-camp at Shechem.  A Catholic priest, a
tall fair man, astonishingly handsome,&mdash;who was suffering
brutal ill-usage at the hands of Hamid Bey...."
</p>

<p>
"'Hamid Bey!'"  She caught at the name.  "Colonel Yaill
speaks of that man in my letter....  He is the Turkish
Commandant of the prison-camp at Shechem." ...
</p>

<p>
"He ought to be Commandant of a Division in Hell, going
by what I've heard of him!  By the way, may I ask you not
to mention his name in the hearing of my aunt....  For we
Hazaëls," said John with a bitter sneer&mdash;"have a little family
score of our own to settle with His Excellency, Hamid Bey,
Miralai of the Shechem Prison Camp...."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not forget.  I will make a point of being
careful! ... But forgive me if I ask you again, how you think
this officer&mdash;Major Essenian Pasha&mdash;could help my brother
now? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Well, for one thing, knowing the lie of the camp pretty
well, the Pasha could carry a passenger....  A man who'd be
prepared for risks&mdash;to some place in the neighbourhood of
Shechem.  At night, of course I mean,&mdash;and drop him there
quietly, and fly back at a stated hour&mdash;and pick him up
again!  He could even&mdash;given a suitable machine, made to
carry more weight and bulk than a mere two-seat scouter&mdash;pick
up two men near Shechem&mdash;and take them to the British
lines!"
</p>

<p>
She drank in the words, her fascinated gaze fixed on the
long mahogany-hued hawk-face, which held her with the
unwavering stare of its glowing black eyes.  She asked with a
catch in her hurried breath:
</p>

<p>
"And the&mdash;the 'man prepared for risks,' who would undertake
to venture&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Disguised as a Bedawi of a tribe on good terms with
the Turks....  I know enough Arabic to get on with.  That
takes the edge off the risk ... lessens the handicap!  Call
the chances seventy-five to one against&mdash;" said John Hazel
coolly,&mdash;"and I suppose you wouldn't be so much over the
estimate! ..."
</p>

<p>
"But"&mdash;she heard her voice coming from a long way off,
out of a breathless stillness: "where is the man who would
undertake so perilous a thing?"  <i>Edward!</i> her heart throbbed
in her, <i>he is thinking of Edward!</i> ...
</p>

<p>
John Hazel answered quietly:
</p>

<p>
"You see the man here! ..."
</p>

<p>
"You? ..."
</p>

<p>
Her heart gave a great leap against Yaill's hidden letter,
stopped&mdash;and then went on beating again:
</p>

<p>
"You mean yourself?&mdash;and I thought&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I told you I estimated the chances against, at seventy-five
to one.  So it isn't quite the sort of job you start another
man on!  It's the kind of thing you calculate to carry through
on your own hook.  The only thing that badgers me is the
chance that your friend the Colonel&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met.  He went on, slowly syllabling the words:
</p>

<p>
"Might be&mdash;calculating to play his own game about when I
start mine.  And for us to clash&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The startled intake of her breath did not escape him.  She
finished:
</p>

<p>
"Would be fatal....  Yes&mdash;I can understand! ..."
</p>

<p>
"For us to clash would bally well upset the apple-cart.
You've no idea when Colonel Yaill&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He has not named a date! ..."
</p>

<p>
"But he is going to have a shot at getting your brother out
of that labour hell at Shechem...."  He studied her face,
with its clear eyes and sweet determined mouth....  "And he's
told you so in confidence&mdash;and you're not going to give away
the show! ... Of course you're right!  Still&mdash;you'll own&mdash;it's
a bit of a handicap....  'Too many cooks....'  But I'm
forewarned, so we'll hope the broth won't be spoiled!  Wish
we could send the Colonel the tip&mdash;but in that line there's
nothing doing!  One thing I'm sure of.  He'd know me again
wherever he happened to knock up against me!&mdash;and I'd know
him if I saw his skin nailed on a gate!"  She shuddered, and
he added, as a short, slight, dark-skinned officer came out at
the lower door opening on the loggia, ushered with scrupulous
respect by the black-robed Ephraim.  "Now,&mdash;may I present
to you Major Essenian Pasha? ... He has something to say
to me on the quiet about this&mdash;projected excursion, or he
wouldn't have dropped in here! ... Lives at Ismailia, as I've
said....  And before him, better drop no hint of knowing
what I've told you....  I'll explain later, why I think it
best...."
</p>

<p>
She said, proudly rearing her beautiful head on her long
white throat:
</p>

<p>
"You need fear no incautious betrayal of your confidence
from me...."
</p>

<h3>
XI
</h3>

<p>
John Hazel got up from the granite seat, saluted Miss Forbis,
and moved with long strides across the lawn, to meet the
visitor....
</p>

<p>
With strained interest Katharine watched the meeting.
The Egyptian Flying Officer, a dark-skinned, bright-eyed, wiry
man, whose short and slight, but muscular and active figure
was set off by his well-cut uniform of khaki cotton-drill,&mdash;said
something in a rapid undertone as he met Hazel.  Hazel
replied.  Their colloquy lasted barely a minute, but to
Katharine, vibrating with the sense of great issues, it seemed as
though the few words spoken by the Egyptian had settled the
question at stake.
</p>

<p>
Then both men crossed the greensward together, the top of
the Pasha's sun-helmet barely on a level with Hazel's middle
arm.  Hazel presented Major Essenian Pasha.  The Egyptian
bowed like a Frenchman, from the hips, and was profoundly
honoured to meet Miss Forbis, of whom he had heard so much
from Lady Donnithorpe.  And Katharine, responding with her
high-bred grace and composure to his frothy compliments,
found herself at once repelled and attracted by something in
this man.
</p>

<p>
Small, alert, dark-hued as bronze, with the long, narrow eyes,
the wide brows and curving profile of the statues of the
Egyptian god Horus, Essenian Pasha might have been barely
past thirty, and certainly conveyed the idea of mental vigour,
abounding health and restless vitality.
</p>

<p>
"I had the pleasure some years back," he said to Katharine,
"of meeting in Cairo an English officer who may be
your relation!  Captain Mark Forbis, of a regiment belonging
to the Brigade of Guards....  He was for a short period,
A.D.C. to the Commander-in-Chief at Ismailia.  Captain Forbis
was exceedingly handsome.  May I say, although he was a
blond man, and blue-eyed, that I detect a remarkable
resemblance to him in you...."
</p>

<p>
Katharine answered as the speaker waited, with his gleaming
eyes upon her:
</p>

<p>
"My brother Mark held a Captaincy in a well-known
Guards Regiment, the 'Cut Red Feathers.'  He was killed at
Mons in August, 1914."  She added, of purpose, "My younger
brother Julian is a Catholic monk of the Order of S. Gerard.
He served as a Chaplain with our troops at Suvla and
Gallipoli...."
</p>

<p>
The Pasha's beryl eyes suddenly lightened.  He said in his
most suave and dulcet tones, his slender fingers smoothing his
clipped black moustache:
</p>

<p>
"Your brother has then undergone some terrible experiences.
May I venture to ask if he was present at the assault on
Scimitar Hill?"
</p>

<p>
"He was with his brigade when the 29th Division fought
their way up through the scrub-fire."  Too late she caught a
warning glance from John Hazel's sombre eyes.
</p>

<p>
"He was not wounded? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;hope not!  I&mdash;I believe not...."
</p>

<p>
"It must have been a great joy to welcome him back again!"
</p>

<p>
"It would be, if&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If I had!" the sentence would have ended....  But she
broke off, her cheeks and the rims of her delicate ears and her
fair temples crimson.  Yet, after all, why should she
prevaricate?  What matter if the man did know, thought candid
Katharine?  Was he not going to help Julian&mdash;at least,
according to John Hazel?  Why, then, had John enjoined reserve
and secrecy? ...
</p>

<p>
Her quick flush faded, but it had not escaped the observation
of Essenian.  The Horus smile on his dark, smooth lips was
subtler and more insinuating, and the gleam between the lids
of his long-lashed eyes more languid than before, as he said:
</p>

<p>
"I understand.  Though the Allied Forces have been
withdrawn&mdash;and the Campaign of the Dardanelles is relegated
to the pigeon-hole where Whitehall keeps its failures&mdash;your
brother has not been lucky enough yet to obtain leave? ..."
</p>

<p>
He seemed to be probing, with his bland, persistent questions
and veiled looks of sympathy, in Katharine's aching heart.
She gave a little, irresistible shudder.  He saw it, and
continued in his smooth, caressing voice:
</p>

<p>
"Or possibly the duties of a priest detain Mr. Forbis
elsewhere?  We Easterns have a proverb&mdash;it may be new to you:"
The insinuating tones were even more gentle and velvety:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>For a plain man to become a priest is robbery of one
woman.  For one handsome man who becomes a priest a
hundred women are robbed!</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The tone, rather than the words, conveyed something
indescribably offensive.  John Hazel started, palpably, and his
scowl was thunderous.  Wrath surged in Katharine's blood and
she tingled to the finger-tips with a momentary, almost
ungovernable desire to strike this man's smooth face.  Scandalised
at herself, furious with him, she commanded herself sufficiently
to say in cool unruffled tones, rising from her seat:
</p>

<p>
"Charmed to have met you, Major Essenian Pasha....
Mr. Hazel, ever so many thanks for showing us your beautiful
house.  Now I must go and say good-bye to your aunt, and
collect my friend, Lady Wastwood, for we are due at the
Hospital.  No!&mdash;please don't come with me&mdash;though you
might 'phone for the car! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Mine is at the door....  I should be honoured and charmed
if Miss Forbis and her friend would use it!" came in the soft
ingratiating tones of Essenian....
</p>

<p>
John Hazel, already striding towards the house, halted and
wheeled, looking at Katharine.  Something in the expression
of his black eyes conveyed the warning: It would be wiser not
to snub this man!  And, with revolt and distaste thrilling in
her blood, Miss Forbis forced herself to smile and be gracious,
and accept the officious offer of the Pasha's automobile.
</p>

<p>
"One moment, my King of Damascus, while I instruct my
chauffeur where to take the ladies, and call for me later....
'The Palace, Montana,' is it not?" Essenian said to John Hazel,
glancing at a platinum watch in a band of grey gazelle-leather,
strapped on his slender dusky wrist.
</p>

<p>
If a second rapid exchange of glances between Katharine
and Hazel did not escape his observation, he gave no sign.  He
smiled, and went back across the lawn to the house,
a small, slender figure, moving with short rapid steps, almost
mincingly, and&mdash;for the Pasha's presence oppressed her
physically&mdash;Katharine could breathe freely again....
</p>

<p>
"Miss Forbis!"  John Hazel spoke quickly and in an undertone:
"It's for your own sake I presumed to dictate to you just
now in the matter of accepting the Pasha's civility.  You see,
when you let out your brother was a priest, you put Major
Essenian wise to the prisoner's identity.  Can't very well snub
a man when he's going to risk his life for you!  And the
thing's fairly settled.  We leave Ismailia Air Station for
Shechem at the latest," he glanced at his wrist-watch, "by three
to-morrow morning!"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow morning! ..."  She caught her breath, and he
could see her heart's tumultuous throbbing under the thin
white silk of her dainty blouse.
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear John Hazel!" she said with passionate fervour,
her wide eyes, their irises mere tawny circles round the dilated
pupils,&mdash;fixed upon his swarthy, excited face....  "May God
protect and keep you!&mdash;and help you to save him!&mdash;my dear
old Julian&mdash;my poor boy! ... Tell me how long I have to
wait before I may hope to hear from you!  How and when
shall I hear? ..."
</p>

<p>
"If things go wrong I can't answer for your hearing...."
John grinned with the grin of Private Abrahams....  "Unless
they let me come back from the Other Side to report!
But if things go right,&mdash;and we get your brother out of
that"&mdash;he did not finish the sentence, "I pledge you my word you shall
hear from me within twenty-four hours of the snatch!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  And&mdash;Mr. Hazel," she was holding out two
letters, one inscribed only with a name, the other addressed
twice over&mdash;once in a large, ornate, feminine hand, to
"Lieut. Col. Edward Yaill, Kerr's Arbour, Cauldstanes, Tweedshire,
N.B." and again in old Whishaw's staggering round-hand to
"Care of Miss Forbis, No. &mdash;th Unit V.A.D. Royal Red Cross
Society, Care of the Commandant Convalescent Hospital,
Montana, Alexandria, Egypt."
</p>

<p>
"Were these a charge for me?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I am going to ask you to take them with you, in
case you should again meet Colonel Yaill.  One is my answer
to the letter you brought.  There is a line in it for Julian....
You see," she turned the envelope, "I have sealed it with my
onyx ring.  That is Julian's really&mdash;and a day may come when
I shall be able to hand it over to him!  The other came
yesterday with my mail from Home....  I do not know, but I
imagine&mdash;it is from the lady who&mdash;is Colonel Yaill's wife...."
</p>

<p>
"Righto!  I'll take 'em both along.  If I can't get 'em where
they ought to go, you shall have 'em back anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!"  She drew a breath of sheer relief as he took the
letters from her.  Ah! my sweet-hearted Katharine.  How
womanfully you had striven with the urgent desire to tear that
buff-coloured envelope, leprous with stamps of different hues
and scored with many postmarks, into a thousand infinitesimal
pieces; and how thoroughly, as things turned out,&mdash;you would
have been punished if you had....
</p>

<p>
"Does it strike you as it does me," John glanced at the
concave impression of her ring, "that just about here is
where&mdash;"  He stooped his tall head nearer and dropped his voice to a
tone even lower, "that just here's where the signet both of us
wear may be useful!  Don't take any screed you get from me
as Gospel truth&mdash;because it happens to be signed 'John Hazel'!
Even suppose you got a line from me, saying, '<i>Come at once!</i>'&mdash;don't
come unless the paper bears an impression of this...."  He
thrust forward the big left hand that wore the onyx head
of Hercules.  "Stuck underneath the signature, in sealing-wax,
or clay, or mud&mdash;or bread, even....  And test it by the
ring you wear, before you accept it....  And seal your
communications to me in the same old way.  Do you tumble?  I
mean&mdash;do you say 'Done!'"
</p>

<p>
"Done! ..."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;you trust me? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I trust you absolutely!  Even though you sent for me, not
saying why I was needed, the signet-seal would be enough&mdash;I'd
say 'Julian,' and come! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Then that's arranged! ..."  He saw in the sudden change
of her face that something menaced.  Even before he turned his
head the smooth voice of Essenian said, a long way below the
level of his own great shoulder:
</p>

<p>
"I have given the necessary instructions to my chauffeur.
He will take the ladies out to the Hospital, Montana, and
come back to pick us up, at the 'Aviators' Club.'  For,
remember, you are engaged to dine with me there, my King of
Damascus, and sleep at my house at Ismailia to-night....  I
have obtained you the necessary leave from your C.M.O. at
the General Hospital."  He turned to Katharine, and the beryl
eyes and the dazzling teeth gleamed together in the bronze face
as he resumed: "Dear lady, do you wonder why I bestow that
title on our friend? ... Because it belongs to him.  He
descends&mdash;although he may not know it&mdash;in an unbroken line
from Hazaël, King of Damascus&mdash;the son and successor of the
Scriptural Ben-Hadad&mdash;against whom Shalmaneser II. of Assyria
waged war, in the year 842, before your Christian Era.
In one of the cabinets in that room"&mdash;he pointed to the
windows looking on the loggia&mdash;"is a clay tablet inscribed in
Semitic&mdash;Assyrian-Cuneiform,&mdash;an heirloom preserved in your
family," he looked at John, "for many centuries."
</p>

<p>
"How tremendously interesting!" Katharine commented,
doing her best to be pleasant with this man, for whom she
had conceived, what she was wont to term, one of her loathings:
"My brother Julian used at one time&mdash;I suppose he has
forgotten it all now!&mdash;to dabble a good deal in Semitic&mdash;tell
me if I pronounce the rest of it badly!&mdash;Assyrian-Cuneiform.
He was secretary and amanuensis to the Father General of his
Order, Abbot Lansquier, of whom perhaps you may have
heard."
</p>

<p>
"He is a great man.  I have heard of him," said the Egyptian,
quickly.  "He would be interested in this tablet.  It is,"
he went on addressing John, "a letter from Achab, King of
Israel, in answer to some communication from Hazaël....
Your late grandfather and I were much interested in deciphering
it at one time.  We translated it into Hebrew, French,
and English&mdash;and though I might miss out a word occasionally,
I could repeat the substance of the letter by heart."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And he began to repeat in his smooth voice:
</p>

<p><br></p>

"<i>Now let us measure our strength together against this
scornful King of Assyria, fat with the conquest of Tabul, and
Milid, where are the silver, salt and alabaster mines.  I, the
King of Israel, with two thousand chariots and ten thousand
soldiers, and thou the King of Damascus with seven hundred
horsemen and twenty thousand unmounted men.  And thou
and I will be brothers, and thy son shall take to him my
daughter; and the dowry I will give him with the Princess shall be
twenty talents of gold, twenty-three thousand talents of silver,
five thousand talents of copper, with coloured raiment from
Egypt, mantles adorned with embroidery, a jewelled diadem,
an ivory couch, a parasol of ivory studded with jewels, all
which shall be delivered thee in Damascus, in the chambers
of thy palace there.  This is the word of Achab, King of
Israel, to Hazaël the King of Damascus.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As the Egyptian repeated the final words, looking at John
Hazel, Katharine, whose eyes had followed Essenian's, recognised
with a thrill of alarm, the now familiar transformation
of the swarthy face with the great hooked nose, into a mask
of stone.  The light died out of the man's black eyes.  He
seemed to be mentally searching.  She knew that he groped
for the end of the spider-thread that linked for him the Present
and the Past.
</p>

<p>
Essenian, in the same instant, saw the change and stopped
in sheer amazement.  He was about to speak, when the
monotonous voice came from the mouth of the mask:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>So it was, and there was a compact, and peace between
Hazaël and Achab; and Istâr the Princess of the House of
Israel, was wedded to the son of King Hazaël.  And Achab
and Hazaël went forth together to meet the King of Assyria;
and he fought with them and defeated them, and destroyed
with weapons sixteen thousand soldiers, and took eleven hundred
chariots, and four hundred and thirty horses, and all the
treasures of their camps.  And he drove King Hazaël from the
Fortress of Mount Saniru, and laid waste towns and villages,
and hemmed him in Damascus, even the city of his glory.  Its
gardens of trees he cut down.  And he slew the King with a
stone from a war-engine, even in the Court of his Palace; and
his son reigned instead of him, and paid tribute to the King of
Assyria.  But the Queen said, 'Must I bear a son to the son of
him who has been worsted in battle?'  And she ceased not&mdash;day
nor night to taunt&mdash;him, like Lilith&mdash;who&mdash;</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The voice faltered, broke, and stopped short.  And Katharine,
noting Essenian's rapid breathing, guessed, despite his
well-maintained composure, that curiosity and interest raged
in him.
</p>

<p>
"Is there no more, my King?" he almost whispered.  "Think
again....  There must be more to tell!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>And the Queen, Istâr, said: 'Woe is me!  For the star
of this house is declining, and the days of its glory are done!
I cannot go back to my father, for Achab has turned himself to
idols.  But if this that I bear in my womb be a son, he shall
worship the God of Israel in His Temple at Jerusalem....
For there is none other than Him!</i>'"  The dragging voice
stopped.
</p>

<p>
"And then ... what more?  There must be more!" urged
the Egyptian, avidly.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;cannot! ..."
</p>

<p>
John Hazel stared glassily at Essenian, and as Essenian
looked back at him with long gleaming eyes of beryl, he
lifted a hand to his forehead as though bewildered, and a dew
of fine globules of perspiration broke out and glittered upon
his temples, and cheeks, and jaws....  And, then, stirred
to solicitude, warned by some inward voice to interpose,
Katharine stretched forth her own hand and touched
John Hazel lightly on the hand he lifted, saying in her clear,
full, womanly tones:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hazel!"
</p>

<p>
"You ... you wanted me?"
</p>

<p>
He asked the question dully, but in his natural, ordinary
voice.  His black eyes lost their glassy stare as they
encountered Katharine's....  And holding them with her own
bright, steady gaze, she spoke to him again.
</p>

<p>
"It is getting late.  Will you please find your aunt and the
Commandant and tell Lady Wastwood that a car is waiting;
and that we have only sufficient time to get back to the
Hospital by seven!"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  In half a jiff! ..."
</p>

<p>
He shook himself, and moved off with his lengthy strides
in the direction of the shrubbery.  And the beryl eyes of
Essenian were on Katharine, scintillating evilly, and the
smooth lips were stretched in that inscrutable, hateful
smile....
</p>

<p>
"A very remarkable type of man&mdash;our good friend Hazel!"
Essenian said, still smiling; and Katharine returned in cool,
unruffled tones:
</p>

<p>
"Remarkable, and interesting."
</p>

<p>
"You find that? ..."  What hinted meaning lurked behind
that smooth interrogation?  "Physically and <i>psychologically</i>, I
myself find him quite uniquely interesting.  His is a curiously
dual personality; does it not strike you as being so?  What
wonderful powers of clairvoyance are his!  What a link
between the Seen and the Unseen, such powers might forge, for
one who could employ them well!  A Seeker after Wisdom,
such as I am myself...."  He drew out a fine white linen
handkerchief exhaling some delicate essence, and passed it over
his face, and dried the palms of his dark hands.  The hands
shook; their owner was the prey of some overmastering
agitation as he went on: "But why should I speak ambiguously to
one who understands?  I saw him pass into the trance, from
which you roused him by the exercise of your will....  You
who can control&mdash;naturally you desire to keep to yourself,
such a gift as Mr. Hazel's&mdash;a source of knowledge beyond all
estimate...."
</p>

<p>
He went on, with increasing earnestness and persistence,
as, conscious of increasing dislike and resentment, Katharine
looked at him without making any reply:
</p>

<p>
"Miss Forbis, you may not know that I am rich....
Whether you are so yourself or not, ladies appreciate exquisite
jewels, and I own many that are unusually fine....  Gratify
me in connection with my desire to see your friend in a similar
condition to&mdash;that I just now had the privilege of witnessing!
Permit me to question him&mdash;and name your price! ... Do
not be offended, I entreat!" the Egyptian pursued, warned by
the flush on Katharine's cheek, and the frown that gathered
on her forehead&mdash;"There may be something in which I can
serve you....  If so, command me....  I ask no more! ..."
</p>

<p>
He changed his tone as John Hazel returned, accompanying
Lady Wastwood and Mrs. Hazaël.
</p>

<p>
"I mentioned to you a little previously that&mdash;several years
ago,&mdash;your late brother, Captain Forbis, honoured my poor
house at Ismailia by being my guest.  May I hope that you
will similarly honour me?  The gardens are really worth
seeing....  Though the house, naturally, does not boast the
interest attaching to this...."
</p>

<p>
"You are most kind, Essenian Pasha," Katharine returned,
somewhat hesitatingly, conscious on the one hand of the
insolence of the native who had presumed to offer her a bribe,
painfully sensible, on the other, of the fact that Julian's
freedom possibly depended on the co-operation of this
unspeakably objectionable man.  "But the time at my own disposal
being so exceedingly limited, it would be impossible to give
you a date."
</p>

<p>
"My profound regrets!"  He bowed from the hips with his
acquired French elegance.  "Though I hope that a day will
come yet when you will consent to honour me!  Most of
the beautiful English ladies who have visited our country
have praised the house and garden....  Must the dwelling be
darkened, and the trees about it wither, because denied the
presence of the most beautiful of all! ..."
</p>

<p>
The flourishing Eastern hyperbole was delivered with
Essenian's velvety softness, and accompanied by a display of
glittering eyes and teeth.  And Katharine, stifling her acute
dislike as might best be managed, thanked the Egyptian in
some formal phrase of polite regret and gratitude&mdash;cut short
as John Hazel returned accompanying Trixie and
Mrs. Hazaël, by the less formal utterances of leave-taking....
Mrs. Hazaël, in taking Katharine's offered hand, made the
slight curtsey appropriate to Royalty.  And Katharine, as she
bent to kiss the little lady's cheek, was conscious that Essenian's
strange eyes leapt out of their drowsy languor into glittering
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
She had longed to give John Hazel another hearty hand-grip,
to have whispered another parting word,&mdash;but the Egyptian
intervened....
</p>

<p>
It was Essenian who conducted Miss Forbis to the car,
a palatial Daimler of huge size, enamelled black and violent
red; overloaded with solid silver and ivory fittings; lined with
primrose satin brocade upholstery, and driven by a handsome
Italian chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
"How gorgeous!  And in what native taste!" cried Trixie,
delightedly as the springy yellow cushions received her.  "And
does it belong to the Egyptian Flying Officer&mdash;the little,
purring Pasha with the extraordinary eyes?  I shall call him 'The
Basilisk' because he reminds me of one!"
</p>

<p>
They had quitted the dust and racket of the city, and as
they passed through the Rosetta Gate, and out upon the
Aboukir Road, and were in the quiet suburbs on the east,
near the European cemetery, Katharine rose and looked back,
and gave a cry of admiration.  For Alexandria,&mdash;with her
domes and minarets and huge square blocks of modern
buildings,&mdash;bathed in the rose and amber light of an Egyptian
sunset&mdash;was beautiful with something of the beauty of the
Past....
</p>

<p>
"That is something to have seen," Katharine said with a
sigh, as she dropped back on the springy primrose cushions.
"Thank you, dear Lady Wastwood, for a wonderful afternoon!
You have been happy, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite amused," Lady Wastwood answered.  "And if I
haven't been quite happy, well, then neither have you!"
</p>

<p>
She moved nearer to Katharine, and took her hand, and
patted it, affection mingling with solicitude in the green eyes
that questioned the face of her friend.
</p>

<p>
"I won't make pretences to you, dear Commandant," Katharine
returned after an instant's hesitation.  "I have cause
to be happy, and cause to be anxious.  And the anxiety weighs
so heavily that Happiness kicks the beam."
</p>

<p>
Trixie patted her hand again, and said as the car bowled
along the Aboukir Canal Road with its charming country
villas shaded by palms and casuarina-groves:
</p>

<p>
"If I can help in any way, you promise&mdash;you will let me?
Won't treat me like a stranger&mdash;will give me the chance I'd
like....  To show you that I don't forget&mdash;what I can never
speak of, but what I live through in my dreams&mdash;nearly every
night!  Promise!  For I am a lonely woman, Kathy dear,
though I keep my end up and don't go round howling for
sympathy!&mdash;and I am truly fond of you."
</p>

<p>
"I promise, dear friend.  And I would tell you now what
the trouble is&mdash;because I trust you absolutely&mdash;where I
myself am concerned!  But I am not free to give away the
confidence of another."
</p>

<p>
"Meaning the Jew Colossus with the great hooked nose,"
said Trixie mentally.  And Katharine went on:
</p>

<p>
"You're looking better.  You've not had that dream of late.
Probably because it has done you good&mdash;sleeping in the
open."
</p>

<p>
For Lady Wastwood and Miss Forbis shared one of the
roomy sleeping-tents in the grounds of the Palace, distinguished
from other similar groups as the "V.A.D's Annexe."
</p>

<p>
"I shall hate it when the rains come and drive us back
indoors," Trixie responded.  "And to-night at any rate I
shan't dream of shipwreck,&mdash;I shall dream of The Basilisk!
That man gives me cold shivers all down my spinal column.
Why, I couldn't exactly explain.  Some people have a horror
of cats&mdash;the gentlest and most faithful pets to those who love
and understand them.  Others simply abominate dogs&mdash;I'm not
keen on them myself!  But my feeling for the little Pasha isn't
one of those mild antipathies.  Shall I tell you what those
basilisk eyes of his keep saying to me?  No!&mdash;it's all
right&mdash;the chauffeur can't hear!  They say: 'My dear lady&mdash;I'm a
wealthy Gyppo Notability, esteemed an Ace of Aces in the
hand of the R.F.C....  I've a chestful of decorations&mdash;all
earned brilliantly.  <i>But my Mother was a Tigress&mdash;and my
Father was a Snake!</i> ...'"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Est ce que les dames feront un petit tour en campagne,
ou retourneront elles directement à l' Hôpital?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Will the ladies take a little tour in the country, or return
directly to the Hospital?"
</p>

<p>
The question, asked in French through the speaking-tube
fixed above the seat in front of them, made Katharine and
the Commandant start.  Briefly informed of the ladies' desire,
the Italian turned the car upon the sanded road curving past
the Khedivial Palace; and after half-a-dozen miles, swept round
in a northward curve and presently was climbing a gradient
between the orchards of peach and apricot trees, the
fig-groves and pine-woods and gardens of beautiful Montana,
gleaming like a fairy palace of rosy mother o' pearl in the
fires of the sunset; on the square green promontory at whose
shoreward base break the pearl and sapphire surges of the
Western Sea.

</h3>

<p>
"The name of Forbes is common enough in your North
Britain&mdash;the name of Forbis sufficiently unusual, to put me
on the scent.  And&mdash;one looks for the lady in these affairs!"
purred Essenian, as he left the house in the Rue el Farad
with John Hazel&mdash;profiting by the coolness of the evening to
walk to the Aviators' Club.  "Let me add, your taste is
unimpeachable.  I have never seen a handsomer Englishwoman
than your friend."
</p>

<p>
Now he pursued, in his smooth, book-learned English,
drawing out a platinum cigarette case&mdash;opening and offering
it to John:
</p>

<p>
"Take one.  The Macedonian leaf failed last year, but not
so the crops of Shiraz, grown and ripened side by side with
the purple-petalled afiyûn.  You perhaps may not know this
Club..." he added a little later, as they entered the wide,
cool vestibule of a handsome granite building in Sherif Pasha
Street.  "No!  Well, I anticipated you would not! ... Originally
an association of mere amateur civilians, meeting
periodically to exchange experiences&mdash;the Club has become,&mdash;since
Government took over our aërodrome and hangars&mdash;you know
them!&mdash;near the Water Works due east of Aboukir Road&mdash;a
resort for Flying Officers of all grades and branches of the
Service....  Since then, if much more social&mdash;we are a damnable
lot more noisy and a good deal less exclusive....  Still,
our Club remains distinguished by its European comfort, and
its excellent <i>cuisine</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The dining-room into which a demure Levantine waiter
ushered Essenian and his companion, was perfectly ventilated
by electric appliances, and open along the whole of one side
towards a sanded court containing a fountain, a great many
long cane-chairs and several palms; and of the many small
tables dotted over the spotless matting covering the floor,
the majority were empty, though apparently reserved for
diners.  A few were already occupied.  With the men who
sat at them,&mdash;officers of the R.F.C. from the land-stations in
the neighbourhood, and others of the R.N.A.S. from the
sea-plane-stations at Ramleh, Port Said, Wara in the Delta,&mdash;and
the seaplane-carrier anchored at the moment in the Port,
Essenian exchanged nods and salutes of smiling courtesy.
Several of the younger men stood up to greet him&mdash;though
none approached the table where the Egyptian airman sat
with a long-legged private of Territorials, wearing the badges
of a London Regiment....
</p>

<p>
The temperature of the room approximated to that of
London in July, thanks to the incessant movement of the
wooden ceiling-fans.  The dinner began excellently, with <i>hors
d'œuvres</i> of giant prawns, miniature cucumbers and fresh
olives, and a shell-fish of delicate flavour, served on
miniature mountains of finely pounded ice.  A Comet hock
accompanied, and a clear soup was succeeded by a <i>turban de turbot</i>,
perfectly cooked, and a curry of tiny whitebait-like fish from
the Canal.
</p>

<p>
Roast lamb and duckling followed, both of remarkable
succulence, and John Hazel, who had lived for weeks on
bully-beef and onions, tough Palestine goat-mutton, and
slabby rice-pudding speckled with the bodies of defunct
flies,&mdash;having&mdash;in the unavoidable absence of these&mdash;cheerfully
battened on iron rations, the bottom of a tin of jam and a
handful of sticky dates,&mdash;yielded now to the immemorial allure of
the Egyptian fleshpots; and attacking dish after dish with the
ferocity of an ogre, slaked his huge thirst with repeated
draughts of the well-iced champagne supplied....
</p>

<p>
The magnificent red roses massed in a crystal and silver
rose-bowl in the centre of their table, and the gratification of
satisfying the hunger that raged in him, prevented him from
grasping a fact to which he awakened later,&mdash;when quail from
Upper Egypt with egg-plant and quince salad, and snipe from
the marshes of the Delta succeeded the lamb and duckling,
and he paused to gather breath....  For Essenian sat smiling
on the other side of the roses, before unused cutlery and silver,
and an array of wine-glasses innocent of wine.
</p>

<p>
"My hat!  Pasha, what must you think of me?" John began,
nearly dropping the fork and spoon that were lifting a
plump quail from the offered dish: "This ain't your Ramadan,
is it, by any chance?  No, of course, that comes in May.
Has anything put you off your feed, or don't you ever eat?"
</p>

<p>
"Have no anxiety on my account, my King of Damascus,"
returned Essenian, narrowing his long eyes as he smiled upon
his guest: "I am well, and that I continue so, I owe to
precautions which may seem absurd to you.  But every advantage
we enjoy in this world has to be purchased&mdash;and I purchase
vigour and health at the expense of my appetite....
Pray do justice to the quail, while I follow my usual rule."
</p>

<p>
He clapped his hands, and an Egyptian body-servant, who
had stood immovable in the background, holding a silver tray,
moved noiselessly forwards and set before Essenian a goblet of
crystal and a long-necked crystal beaker;&mdash;together with some
small covered dishes of delicate porcelain, revealing when the
covers were lifted&mdash;nothing beyond a few fresh dates, a small,
snow-white cream cheese, and a delicate napkin, enveloping
a round cake of bread.
</p>

<p>
"Distilled water and freshly-gathered fruit, with bread of
the purest sesame-flour....  Of these, in limited quantity,
I may eat twice in the day.  Preferably, at dawn, and after
sunset; though by religion I am no more Moslem than I am
a Christian," said Essenian, daintily filling the crystal goblet,
"or a Parsi, or a Hindu, or a Buddhist, or a Jew...."  He
broke bread....  "What is this? ..."  He turned with feline
suddenness on the dusky servant who stood behind him, and
said harshly, speaking in Arabic: "There is error!  The sesame
has been mingled with wheaten-flour.  It is impure....  I
cannot eat of it! ... Take it away at once...."
</p>

<p>
"<i>La yâ Sidi&mdash;Allâh yisallimak!</i>" the man protested, paling
under his chocolate skin.
</p>

<p>
But Essenian had sniffed the bread-cake remotely and delicately
as a fox might sniff at some slily-poisoned titbit, and
now replaced it on the dish, and thrust the dish away....
</p>

<p>
"Carry it to the cook and inquire into the matter!"  He
said to Hazel, as the servant removed the dish and vanished
straightway: "Do not be disturbed on my account!  To one
so well schooled in abstinence as myself, it would matter little
if the meal consisted only of dates.  Mixed in a draught of
this pure water, a few drops of an excellent tonic (to the
virtues of which I am a living testimony) will more than
supply the deficiency....  Meanwhile, do not neglect our <i>chef's</i>
excellent <i>omelette soufflée</i>.  Or the <i>bombe glace</i> of
custard-apple on which he prides himself....  And then&mdash;since I
know better than to offer cheese to a man who has been 'fed
to the wide,' with that as an article of Army rations,&mdash;I will
join you in a cup of Arabian coffee, black, thick and bitter as
the nectar of Mocha should be."
</p>

<p>
He took from a front pocket of his Service jacket a little
case of shining yellow metal, and opening it, showed three
slender crystal vials, reposing in a velvet bed.  He unstoppered
one,&mdash;tinging the air laden with the savour of meats and
viands&mdash;with a whiff of something delicately pungent&mdash;rather
suggesting the fragrance of lemon-plant to John....  Then
with dainty, scrupulous care, he dropped seven drops into the
goblet of distilled water; re-stoppered the vial, wiped the lip
with a green leaf, returned the vial to its bed, and pocketed
the case,&mdash;watching through narrowed eyelids the turbid
changes taking place in the clear liquid, until as it deepened
from cloudy red to clearest ruby, he glanced across the
rose-bowl to encounter Hazel's eyes....
</p>

<p>
"A pretty colour, is it not?" he said critically, holding up
the goblet.  "Now I will drink, and you must join me.  I hope
you do not find fault with our Club champagne? ..."  He
continued, signing to the attendant, who stood ready with
another napkined bottle: "That you have been drinking came
from von Falkenhayn's Headquarters in Transylvania,&mdash;when
we bombed him out of them in the summer of 1916....  That
defeat of the Vulkan Pass must have been a crushing blow to
the Emperor's magnificent favourite,&mdash;coming after the
tremendous failure of the Second Attack on Verdun."
</p>

<p>
To the rout of the Vulkan Pass, John knew, Essenian's
prowess had contributed.  When Roumania had joined the
Allies in the August of 1916, and massed her Army on the
Carpathian frontier for an invasion of Transylvania,
Essenian had acted as Wing Commander of a squadron of
Allied Aircraft, acting in concert with a Roumanian Army
Corps,&mdash;and for his services had been distinguished with the
Order of the Roumanian Crown.  At Salonika, later on,&mdash;for
the first time meeting Essenian&mdash;John had encountered the
French observer who had accompanied the Egyptian's flights.
</p>

<p>
"They are greatly strong in artillery, the Austro-Germans
of von Falkenhayn! ... We are not so....  The Roumanians
are only strong in men.  As we march on they retreat,&mdash;for two
weeks it is a triumph....  Then their von Falkenhayn gives
the signal, and their guns begin to play on us....  I who
speak have been under fire!&mdash;was I not in the advanced
trenches at Verdun with my storming-party, before I joined the
<i>Service Aëronautique</i>!  But this was super-gunnery&mdash;a torrent
of steel and fire and German High Explosive, sweeping&mdash;as
with the Devil's broom&mdash;the mountain-passes clear!  All
through October continues the fight&mdash;every day we are flying!
In fog, and rain&mdash;zut! rain of shrapnel and fog of poison-gas&mdash;we
never cease to fly....  When we are not observing&mdash;we
are bombing!  Or making more rain on the Austro-German
Divisions&mdash;a rain of steel <i>flechettes</i>!  Me, I am no
coward! but whenever M. Essenian Pasha says to me: 'Prunier, this,
day or night, my friend, you accompany me in my <i>avion</i>....'  I
say to myself as we used to say with my storming-party
at Verdun: '<i>Ça va barda, mon ami!  Prepare ton
matricule!</i>'  For M. le Major will fly with a broken wing, or
a bullet through the petrol-tank, and all the juice
running! ... <i>C'est un as!</i> ... He puts in me the fear of
God&mdash;that man who has none at all! ..."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Essenian ate of dates and cheese sparingly,
sipped his tonic drink appreciatively, and waited for the man
on the other side of the crimson roses to talk.
</p>

<p>
"Here is the port."  He added as the servant filled Hazel's
glass from a cobwebbed and ancient-looking bottle: "Don't
drink yet.  Let us follow the ancient fashion, the first glass
of the bottle to a lady's health! ... I propose: 'The beautiful
Miss Forbis! ...'  What, do you break the glass?"&mdash;for John
had nodded, and his huge brown fingers had snapped the stem
of the wineglass like a match-stick as they set it, emptied,
down.  "Take a fresh one,&mdash;finish the bottle,&mdash;and meanwhile
try those cheroots....  Or the others&mdash;excellent Havanas,
though I smoke cigarettes for my own part, or else the
water-pipe&mdash;our Egyptian <i>ârgili</i>.  Ah, here is the coffee," said
Essenian pleasantly, as the Egyptian servant previously
dismissed, re-appeared at his elbow with another tray.  "Black
as the eyes and perfumed as the breath of the brides who lead
the sons of Islam into the green pavilions of Paradise.
Though," he smiled amiably at John over the cigarette he was
lighting, as the attendant removed the empty bottle and placed
a flask of Benedictine with the coffee beside the guest&mdash;"your
personal predilection leans to something statelier and less
seductive than the gazelle-eyed, moon-faced <i>haura</i> of the glorious
Koran....  What says our Saadi: 'The tresses of Beautiful
Ones are chains upon the Feet of Prudence, and a snare upon
the wings of the Bird of Wisdom.....  We Easterners hardly
credit the existence of Friendship between those of opposite
sexes," pursued the Egyptian, letting the sentences trickle over
his smooth lips as though they had been honey, "and yet,
subsisting between an intellectual man, and a mentally-superior
woman, it may be productive of more lasting gratification than
the merely sensual tie."
</p>

<p>
"What are you getting at, Essenian Pasha?" asked his
guest, bluntly.
</p>

<p>
Essenian had paused as though inviting a reply, and this
was the response forthcoming.  A faint line showed between
his smooth black eyebrows and his tones were less sweet and
liquid as he resumed:
</p>

<p>
"But this,&mdash;that such a union between man and woman
might lead to great discoveries&mdash;in those psychological regions
which we are beginning to explore.  Two such adventurers,
mutually keen, mutually gifted with spiritual perception,
bound by sympathies unblunted by the earthly passion of love,
might pass back along paths long buried beneath the <i>débris</i>
of extinct civilisations&mdash;trodden by the footsteps of generations
who went before them, to the furthermost limits of the
Mysterious Unknown."
</p>

<p>
He waited.  This latest opening proved no whit more
successful than others previously given.  John Hazel continued
to drink, and smoke, and answered nothing.  To pry out the
diamond hidden in this lump of living clay,&mdash;to wrench open
the rugged valves of this human mollusc housing the pearl
of priceless knowledge,&mdash;was going to be more difficult than
Essenian had thought....
</p>

<p>
"Your friend, Miss Forbis," he resumed, and now the heavy
eyes were on him, "strikes me as possessing an unusual
degree of psychic force and energy, in combination with her
remarkable physical beauty and charm.  That she is less
handsome than her brother, one would be disinclined to credit,
were her own testimony not corroborated by the evidence of
T.R.S. 43."
</p>

<p>
"And who might the gentleman you mention be, and what
the&mdash;what does he know about it?" demanded John Hazel,
regarding his host with a decided scowl, and speaking in an
aggressive tone.
</p>

<p>
"T.R.S. is a Turkish Renegade Spy whom I recently met
and interviewed at the B.S.I. Office Ismailia," returned
Essenian smoothly, "on a subject of vital interest to your
attractive English friend....  'Describe,' I said, 'this British
priest who lies in prison at Shechem,' and the man answered
'<i>Mashallah!</i>'  Describe the Archangel Jibrail when he came
from the Ninth Heaven to announce to Mary the Pure One
the Miraculous Birth of the Messiah&mdash;between Whom and
the touch of Satan, at the moment of His Nativity&mdash;the Lord
of Creation interposed a veil!'  He was quite serious&mdash;Turks
are idolaters of physical perfection....  Incidentally, he
wound up with a few details concerning the&mdash;disposition, and
predilections distinguishing the Turkish Lieutenant-General of
gendarmerie who is at present Commandant of the Prison
Camp at Shechem,&mdash;which throw a rather lurid light upon the
conditions there...."
</p>

<p>
He chafed his delicate finger-tips softly against each other
as he leaned both elbows on the cloth and smiled over the
roses into Hazel's gloomy eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Hamid is a&mdash;let us say a protégé of the notorious Djemal
Pasha, once Turkish Minister of Marine&mdash;now Commander of
the Fourth and Eighth Turkish Army Corps.  Of mean birth,
a Turk from Crete&mdash;he bids fair to out-Djemal Djemal....
I need not remind you that Crete is&mdash;the country of the
Minotaur! ..."
</p>

<p>
The speaker's beryl eyes shone green in the light of the
electric globe-lamps.  His voice had a little poisonous hiss
through its delicate silkiness.
</p>

<p>
"Since the prison camps of Beersheba were shifted to Shechem,
their Commandant has a narrower field for the exercise
of his peculiar bent....  According to my Turkish spy, he
has what you would call 'a down' upon your friend's brother,&mdash;whose
refusal to be removed from the Barracks to the wired
camp set apart for the officer-prisoners has offended the Bey....
Perhaps the presence of the priest is a check upon his
usage of the soldiers, whom Father Forbis nurses in fever
and other sickness, and for whom he has obtained consular
funds for the purchase of medicines, charcoal for fires, meat
for broth, and so on...."
</p>

<p>
He satisfied himself by a swift glance that John was
absorbed in listening, and resumed: "Turks are&mdash;Turks!"  He
made as though to spit, but checked himself, and went on:
"You have said to me: 'We Hazaëls have an old score to
settle up with Hamid....'  Two years have not changed the
Bey.  He is still the Minotaur! ... And unless Fortune, or,"
he shrugged "the favour of Heaven, operate in the interests
of this brother of your friend, his may yet be the fate from
which self-slaughter saved your Cousin Jacob&mdash;Catholics being
forbidden that last resource of the desperate....  Escape
from torture or degradation by the Gate of Suicide...."
</p>

<h3>
XIII
</h3>

<p>
Drifting down a sluggish stream of drowsy after-dinner
reflections; brooding between a bellyful of varied meats, and
a brain addled with wine;&mdash;lost to the guiding, dominant idea
of the Big Old Men, ranged one behind the other like a
sculptured procession of Assyrian planet-gods, reaching back
to the Beginning of Actualities whence looked down the Biggest
Old Man of All&mdash;John Hazel had been recalled as suddenly
as though a 5.9 shell had exploded in the Club courtyard,
and starting to his feet, upset the chair he had sat on;
its fall&mdash;with the crash of a breaking glass&mdash;making the men
at other tables look round.
</p>

<p>
"<i>In peril such as this, and you sit here drowsing!</i>"
</p>

<p>
It rang in Hazel's singing ears&mdash;the voice of the worshipped
woman.  And in a moment the gorged Sybarite was gone.
With a curt apology he resumed the chair the Club attendant
had picked up and now replaced for him.  A cool, resourceful
man, instinct with force and energy, sat looking at Essenian
across the rose-filled bowl.
</p>

<p>
"If things are as desperate as you've said, why not have
told me?  Let's thrash this out, Essenian Pasha, please!"
</p>

<p>
"With pleasure, but I must first know how Miss Forbis
discovered that her brother was living.  For that she knows,
in spite of her very remarkable reticence,&mdash;was plain to me
to-day.  Was it you who broke that news to her? ..."
</p>

<p>
"No ... She told me! ..."
</p>

<p>
"When? ..."
</p>

<p>
"This afternoon! ..."
</p>

<p>
"That is curious! ..."  The tone was incredulous....
"Through whom did she learn the fact?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't enlighten you! ..."
</p>

<p>
"How long has she known? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I'm unable to say! ..."
</p>

<p>
Scrutinising his guest between narrowed eyelids, sifting
the unwilling replies with inquisitorial care, it was patent to
Essenian that John knew, but would not tell.  He tried again
with no better result.
</p>

<p>
"Has Miss Forbis by any unlucky chance, embarked&mdash;any
other person&mdash;in an effort to rescue her brother from the
prison at Shechem?"
</p>

<p>
This time John flatly lied:
</p>

<p>
"No! ..."
</p>

<p>
"That is well.  I should certainly withdraw from the
attempt if its success were to be so handicapped."
</p>

<p>
"Handicap or none, whether you withdraw or not, I'm
entered for the running!"
</p>

<p>
"I did not say that I withdrew.  On the contrary!"
</p>

<p>
"Good egg you!  Now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
John poured out a brimming glass of iced mineral water,
emptied it, and finished as he set down the empty glass:
</p>

<p>
"How far is Shechem from Ismailia?"
</p>

<p>
"Following the old Pilgrim's route overland&mdash;a distance
of about 232 English miles.  As the crow flies&mdash;or as I shall
fly"&mdash;Essenian smiled&mdash;"about 195 miles...."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  When can we start? ..."
</p>

<p>
"For Shechem? ..."
</p>

<p>
"For Shechem! ..."
</p>

<p>
"That depends!" said Essenian with his titter, as John
glanced at his wrist-watch, and then at the elaborate
clock,&mdash;mounted in captured German gun-metal&mdash;that occupied a
bracket over the door of the dining-room: "That depends
on your readiness to accept my conditions! ..."
</p>

<p>
"'Conditions'?  You wait till now to talk of conditions!"
</p>

<p>
The black eyes were full on Essenian, and they had an
angry stare.
</p>

<p>
"I have purposely waited until now! ..."
</p>

<p>
The cool, sinister strength that lay behind Essenian's veneer
of finical affectation, came home to Hazel as it had not
previously.  This was the Essenian of his French
observer-mechanic, the man who had flown with a broken wing-stay,
and a leaking petrol-tank, through the hellish Austro-German
fire in the battle of the Vulkan Pass.
</p>

<p>
"To push an advantage, consolidate a position and advance
to a point beyond is the science of warfare, and the secret
of social influence.  Shall we discuss these conditions in my
private room upstairs&mdash;or would you prefer to stay here?"
</p>

<p>
John, looking round, saw no occupied table in their near
vicinity, and grunted surlily:
</p>

<p>
"Here's good enough for me! ..."
</p>

<p>
"My own experience supports your view....  Here is
quite good enough....  For the arrangement of the details
of a plot, for the carrying-out of a delicate and dangerous
discussion, the ideal place is&mdash;under the electric lights in the
middle of a drawing-room, in the stalls at a theatre&mdash;in the
dining-room of a Club or restaurant, or in the Throne Room
at a Royal Levée...."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us get to biz.  You've sprung a surprise on me&mdash;at
the last minute...."  John added, fixing his heavy black
stare on the gleaming green eyes of the tiger-snake ambushed
behind the roses; "Still,&mdash;trot out your conditions! ... How
much do you want in cash? ..."
</p>

<p>
"You are rude, Mr. Hazel....  But the young are always
insolent!"  Essenian gave the little bleating laugh.  "I want no
money of you....  Rather I am what the British merchant
would call a warmer man than you are, in spite of the fact
that you inherited from your grandfather more than three
hundred and eighty thousand pounds...."
</p>

<p>
"Upon conditions, Pasha! upon conditions!" jeered John,
grinning over the table; and roused to sudden venomous
wrath, Essenian hissed at him&mdash;leaning over the crimson
flower-hedge until his fierce breath beat on the other's face:
</p>

<p>
"Do I not know you have accepted those conditions? ... Are
you not living&mdash;in some degree&mdash;in your grandfather's
house as a Jew? ... Have you not the letter 'J' instead of
'Nil' on your identification-disc? ... Do you not wear upon
a chain about your neck an enamelled Shield of David?  If
you die, or are killed&mdash;will they not bury you, if anything
be left of you to bury&mdash;under the Mogen David as they bury
a Jew?"
</p>

<p>
The sudden transformation of the languid, smiling oval
into a face of bitter fury evoked a sudden flash of intuition
that made Hazel say:
</p>

<p>
"You seem to know something about it....  Do you happen
to be Hebrew yourself by any chance? ..."
</p>

<p>
"You are perspicuous."  The face was bland again.  "I
am in fact descended from an ancient Israelitish family of
Elephantis.  Not all the sons of the Tribes followed the
Law-giver out of Egypt.  Many had grown to love the land
and&mdash;its many gods were good to them....  So they stayed and
prayed to the many, instead of following the One...."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  Lots of shirkers stopped behind to make bricks
for Pharaoh, and to-day their descendants are laying sleepers,
or digging trenches, or piling shells for the good old British
Government."
</p>

<p>
"You have perfectly mastered the shibboleth of loyalty,
Mr. Hazel...."  The dark lips curled contemptuously.  "I
congratulate you!  But it is hardly necessary to maintain the
pose.  There is no third person present, and I speak as an
Asiatic to an Asiatic, as a Hebrew to a Jew....  For many
years I have served the British Government in our East.
These," he touched the rows of ribbons on his tunic, "testify
to the truth of what I say.  While Britain's aims and my
own interests are synonymous, I shall continue to serve
her...."
</p>

<p>
"I should jolly well hope so!  It's a cleaner job than
plotting for the Kaiser's dirty pay."
</p>

<p>
"And a more profitable&mdash;for Germany is finished.  A burst
bladder, like her sister State with whom she hoped to
dominate the world.  The sun of Russia sets in a morass of blood
and mire and filth unutterable....  Britain and France have
reached their apogee of greatness, and must now inevitably
decline.  The Ottoman Empire fights to her fall.  From the
Farther East the Power will arise that will sweep armies like
straws before it&mdash;and entangle the necks of the Northern
nations within its weighted throwing-net!  But of this another
time.  Let us come to my conditions....  Do not interrupt me
until I have said my say! ... I am no Spiritualist&mdash;I laugh
at those who bear the name as babes, who try to peep behind
the curtain when the showman is admitted to the courtyard
of the <i>harîm</i> to amuse them with his Shadow Play of the
puppet Kharaguz.  But in Spiritism I believe....  Is it not
the corner-stone of all revealed religions, that deep conviction
of the existence of a World Unseen! ... I have myself
made efforts&mdash;and not all unrewarded! to lift the border of the
Veil that hides the Future&mdash;to pierce through the thick mists
that screen the terrors of the Abyss Beyond...."
</p>

<p>
Artificial as were ordinarily the speaker's tone and bearing,
he spoke now, and looked like a man stirred to the very
depths.  His hands vibrated, Hazel thought, like the limbs of
a weaving spider.  He breathed quickly,&mdash;and a hundred lines,
furrows and crowsfeet previously unnoticed, appeared crossing,
re-crossing and puckering the dark skin of his agitated
face....
</p>

<p>
"Mediums and clairvoyants in the European capitals&mdash;have
I not seen and heard them?  With what result?  This, that a
few threads of truth, undeniable and genuine,&mdash;were woven
into a tissue of lies!  Seers and Descryers here in our
East&mdash;with them I have fared better.  They only practise for the
Initiate&mdash;they scorn to prostitute their mystic gifts to the
uses of the common herd.  But by the greatest&mdash;one day you
shall meet them!&mdash;never have I known done what you did
to-day in my presence....  I mean&mdash;when you so marvellously
supplied the context of that cuneiform letter, filling up
with a bridge of Truth the gap between the Known and the
Unknown....  How strange that Eli Hazaël never dreamed
of your astonishing faculty!  How wonderful, the combination
in your person of the temperament of the clairvoyant with
the physique of the athlete! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Why keep on calling me a medium and clairvoyant when
I'm nothing of the sort!  When I tell you I've never dabbled
in that sort of thing.  And what is it&mdash;about the letter?  Do
you mean your translation of the wedge-writing on the tile
in the cabinet, that you reeled off this afternoon? ..."
</p>

<p>
The Egyptian's eyes stabbed at John's face out of deep
caves that had suddenly hollowed about them.  But he could
not doubt the look and tone of absolute sincerity.  He blinked
and muttered:
</p>

<p>
"You do not deceive....  You are speaking truth! ... By
the Fire that burns without Heat or Smoke!&mdash;you are
an extraordinary young man! ..."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The room had gradually emptied about them: they sat in a
desert of unoccupied tables, from whose cloths soft-footed
Levantine and native waiters were clearing wineglasses, coffee-cups
and empty liqueur-bottles,&mdash;decanters, fruit-dishes, plates,
and ash-trays full of burned matches, and the stubs of cigars
and cigarettes....
</p>

<p>
"You have not sought the terrible Gift&mdash;yet it has come to
you.  You are not of the Baal Obh, who evoke the voices of
departed spirits from corpses and mummies&mdash;or of the
Yideoni, who utter oracles and prophesy, by putting into their
mouths a dead man's bone.  You are a Teraph&mdash;a living
Teraph&mdash;not the head of a first-born of a first-born&mdash;prepared
with salt and spices, having under the tongue a gold plate
on which magical formulas have been engraven....  And it
is she, the handsome Englishwoman, who controls the Man
and the Power!  Who says to your mind, as the Chinese
fisherman says to the tamed cormorant: 'Dive!' ... And
at the command you vanish into the Unguessable!&mdash;you
return, carrying in your pouch a fish from the Sea on
which swims the Serpent that bears up the Throne...."
</p>

<p>
He drew towards him an unused plate, reached with a
shaking hand for the part-emptied port-bottle, poured a
little into a glass, and dipping in a finger, rapidly traced in
thick red wine upon the shining white porcelain a square,
divided into nine smaller by horizontal and perpendicular
lines....
</p>

<p>
"Dastûr.  By your Permission, ye Blessed Ones!" John
heard him mutter, as he scattered a drop or two of wine at
each corner of the figure and filled in the squares with numerals.
</p>

<p>
"What are you up to, Essenian Pasha?" John leaned across
interestedly.  "Looks to me like hanky-panky of the Egyptian
Hall kind."
</p>

<p>
"It is the Budûh of el Gazzali, a figure much used in our
East.  Only instead of letters I am using numerals.  Tell me,
my friend&mdash;for of course you are acquainted with it&mdash;what
is the month, and the day, and the hour, of the English lady's
birth? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Damned if I know! ..."
</p>

<p>
"How can I believe you do not know, when she is so intimate
a friend that she wears a facsimile of the onyx gem
that is on your hand now? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Why she has it I couldn't say....  It's an heirloom in
her family....  Now cough up your conditions, for I've
waited long enough.  What do you want me to do in return
for taking me somewhere near the Prison Camp at Shechem,
dropping me and picking me up&mdash;at a given hour&mdash;with
another man in tow? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Consent to be again&mdash;for me&mdash;as you were in the Rue el
Farad."  The Egyptian obliterated the figure on the plate
with a sweep of three fingers, pushed the plate contemptuously
from him and sat erect in his chair.  "Use your power&mdash;pass
behind the Veil as you did this afternoon.  Here as you
sit at this table&mdash;it can easily be managed.  For one
half-hour!&mdash;"  He pointed to the round-faced gun-metal timepiece
solemnly ticking over the dining-room door.  "A quarter
even&mdash;calculated by that clock...."
</p>

<p>
"But haven't I already told you that's all tosh about my
being clairvoyant? ... Can't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Muakkad</i>!  Yes, you have told me, but I have eyes and
ears....  Think, O man! ..."  Both supple hands darted
at John over the roses....  "Lord of the Daystar! cannot
you understand?  Would it be no help to the success of this
expedition if I were able to send you in advance to the Camp
at Shechem?  A spy no sentry can arrest&mdash;no walls keep
out, no bullet silence....  Who hears&mdash;sees all and remains
invisible as the Afrit who flies by noonday, or the Angel
who witnesses sin!"
</p>

<p>
"But you....  Where do you come in?  What's your particular
little stunt, Essenian Pasha?"  The voice was heavily,
oppressively surcharged with suspicion and doubt....
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you, you who suspect one who has served you
and eaten and drunk with you.  This is the year of Fate for
me, this of the Hejira 1335&mdash;by the Kalendars of the Ifranjis
1917.  This coming First of Safar&mdash;their November
Sixteenth&mdash;is the beginning of the month of my dread....  All
may yet be well with me&mdash;for who knows his danger is armed
against it.  And to have lived as I have is to have learned to
value Life!  Only a few years more to wait until great chemists
have grown wiser....  A little, little span of years,&mdash;and
Man, created but to perish, will have done away with Sickness
and abolished Old Age,&mdash;and finally conquered the Enemy,
Death....  Listen! ... I cannot be killed whilst flying&mdash;the
Signs are all against it.  But in a year that has its birth in
el Dali and el Jadi&mdash;in a month that has the signs Akrab, and
of the planets Mirih,&mdash;I am in danger from a man and a
woman.  Peril had threatened me the other day, when I
dropped down in the midst of your lines&mdash;and its source had
been removed and my breast was broadened....  But the
Shadow still broods&mdash;the Finger points&mdash;and I must know who
these Two are&mdash;the people who menace me!"
</p>

<p>
"What happened before you landed in our lines, Essenian
Pasha?"  John's interest had been prodded into life by the
previous reference.  "Three days ago&mdash;or about&mdash;when the
Turkish Anti-Aircraft guns peppered you over&mdash;Hebron,
wasn't it?&mdash;and Captain Usborn was killed....  You see, I've
been wanting to ask you about that poor bloke.  How did he
get his gruel? ..."
</p>

<p>
"How?"  The crouching khaki figure sat erect and the
snaky eyes glittered angrily.  "You saw the corpse....  You
handled it.  A shrapnel bullet killed him.  And it was not
at Hebron it happened,&mdash;but at Shechem."
</p>

<p>
"That's odd! ... You said Shechem at first....  And&mdash;it
wasn't a shrapper! ..."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean? ..."  The voice was a snarl.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, I've got the bullet...."
</p>

<p>
"Where? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Here....  In my pocket....  And&mdash;the queer thing is&mdash;it's
a revolver-bullet.  Not a German&mdash;it isn't nickel-coated.
Might have come from an English Webley of ordinary Army
size."
</p>

<p>
"Show it me!"
</p>

<p>
John produced and handed over the little blunted cone of
metal.  The deadly cold of the dry finger-tips that touched his
in taking it reminded him uncomfortably of the contact of a
snake.  He watched as they turned the bullet about, and then
held out his hand for it.
</p>

<p>
"You want this back again?" the harsh voice asked.
</p>

<p>
"Rather, if you don't mind!&mdash;" John grinned.  "It's my
latest mascot."  He took back the bullet, avoiding the other's
touch, and dropped it in his pocket again.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get it?"  Avidly the sharp glance had followed
the action.  "How can you be certain&mdash;that it is the
bullet that killed the man?"
</p>

<p>
"I helped to lift&mdash;the body&mdash;out of the observer's cockpit,
and mine was the head end...."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Th' h h!</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
It was a sound like the hiss of a snake, betraying desperate
interest.
</p>

<p>
"He&mdash;Usborn&mdash;had been shot through the head....  There
was a scorch on the left temple.  On the right&mdash;a clot of
brains and blood.  And&mdash;when I took hold of his head the
bullet came away with that, and dropped into my hand.
That's curious, now I come to think of it ..."
</p>

<p>
"What is curious?"
</p>

<p>
"That burn on his left temple...."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the bullet was incendiary.  The Germans use such
things."
</p>

<p>
"You forget!  I've got it&mdash;and it isn't!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  The voice had recovered its suavity.  "I am now
able to account for its being a revolver-bullet.  There were
German officers on the defence-works at Shechem&mdash;that they
have strengthened since the evacuation of Beersheba.  And as
they directed the gunners&mdash;we circling the while and
reconnoitring&mdash;Usborn also photographing&mdash;they potted at us with
their revolvers now and then...."
</p>

<p>
"How high were you flying?"
</p>

<p>
"A mile.  I remember I looked at the indicator the moment
before&mdash;it happened."
</p>

<p>
"You're kidding, Essenian Pasha....  You know lots better
than I do that the range of a revolver taking a bullet of this
calibre would be barely 1,550 yards...."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wannebi!</i>"  Foam stood on the writhing lips, and the
veins on the back of the clenched hand that shook at John
across the roses stood out against the bronze skin like knotted
blue cords.  "By the Prophet! though I am no son of his,&mdash;you,
Hazel, tax my patience....  Usborn is dead, and buried
two marches from Sheria.  Let us discuss the cause of his
death when we have time to lose.  Aid me to gain enlightenment
as only you can aid me!&mdash;and I help you to rescue this
Christian priest&mdash;this tonsured Franghi dervish&mdash;from the
barbed-wire cage at the Prison Camp of Shechem.  Is it
agreed?  Speak, for suspense devours my liver!"
</p>

<p>
"All right."  John glanced round at the clock over the door
of the dining-room.  "Nine-fifteen.  I'm at your disposal till
the long hand marks the half-past."
</p>

<p>
"Give me time to get something I shall need from my room,
and swallow a draught of stimulant."  Essenian beckoned
one of the Levantine waiters, gave a rapid order in his fluent
French and clapped his hands for his own man.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Saiyad</i>, I am here!"  The Mohammedan body-servant who
had waited, erect and immovable in the background appeared
at his master's elbow.  "What does my lord command?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to the room where I sleep, and bring me the velvet
case from the table at my bedside."
</p>

<p>
"My lord has said," the man quavered, paling under his
coffee-coloured skin, "that the low-born may not lay a hand
upon the Eye of Radiance, but at peril of blasting as by fire
from the skies!"
</p>

<p>
"Unless thou art commanded.  Go, and return in safety!"
</p>

<p>
The servant vanished and Essenian commented, with his
little contemptuous shrug:
</p>

<p>
"Even as the beasts are the rough and unlettered.  What
says Shaikh Saadi in <i>The Garden of Roses</i>?  I would quote
the original,&mdash;but it may be you do not know Arabic sufficiently
well to appreciate the pun."
</p>

<p>
"Some play upon <i>wahish</i> and <i>wahsh</i>, I suppose?" Hazel
suggested, unexpectedly, as the servants stripped the table
and fenced it round with screens.  "What's your poison this
time?  Something extra special?" he inquired, as Essenian,
with a shaking hand, drew his little case of medicines again
from his pocket and half-filled a liqueur-glass from another
of the vials it held.
</p>

<p>
"Something I seldom need to take, my King of Damascus.
Unless after severe physical exertion,&mdash;or unusual mental
strain.  To your health!  <i>Sirrak!</i>"
</p>

<p>
He swallowed the colourless, scentless contents of the
liqueur-glass; drew a deep breath, squared his shoulders,&mdash;and
under the surprised stare of John, became the man he had
been....
</p>

<p>
"That is good!  Now we get to what you call 'biz.' ..."  He
was smiling again suavely as he took a shabby green velvet
case from the willing hands of his servant, banished the man
beyond the enclosure of the screens with a look and a brief
order couched in the vernacular,&mdash;and placed the case carefully
on the cleared table-cloth before his guest.
</p>

<p>
"Fine stone!  What is it?" John asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
"A beryl, merely.  Do not touch it with your finger lest the
contact dim its brightness."
</p>

<p>
Essenian had opened the case out flat upon the smooth white
linen surface, disclosing a sphere of radiance, resting on the
slender base of a little metal stand.
</p>

<p>
"Sit easily in your chair," he went on; "rest your hands on
either side of it....  Ah, I had forgotten!  Where are those
<i>mallâhe</i>?"  He took a pile of common native glass salt-cellars
from a corner of the table, where a demure-faced Levantine
waiter had just placed them.  "Raise yourself on the chair
a little.  So!  Now sit down again."  John complied, finding
the seat rather higher than it had been before.  "Now I place
one of the <i>mallâhe</i> under each leg of the table...."  The
table kicked four times gently.  "Now the Earth-currents
cannot deviate astral&mdash;or Other Influences&mdash;and the table is not
too low.  You are comfortable?"
</p>

<p>
"Fairly cushy, thanks! ..."
</p>

<p>
Dentists had asked John a similar question.
</p>

<p>
"You are not nervous, Mr. Hazel? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Why on earth should I be? ..."
</p>

<p>
"There is no reason.  Look at the beryl, and do not remove
your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'm on! ... Mind!  From the word 'Go!'
fifteen minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Fifteen minutes....  Look steadily in the beryl.  Now
give the word!"
</p>

<p>
"Go! ..."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Resting a hand lightly on the table, on each side of the
little cup-topped pedestal supporting the gleaming, spherical
stone, John leaned forwards, steadily looking in it,&mdash;and the
fold between his beetling eyebrows smoothed, and the spark
of excitement that had kindled in his black eyes slowly
smouldered out....
</p>

<p>
He had gone much further than he meant to have done,
but there had been no help for it.  Katharine's desperate need
of help, the more desperate need of Julian, had thrust him over
the edge of this pit the astute Egyptian had dug.  But whether
Essenian were a wizard or a charlatan&mdash;and at moments John
was inclined to the wizard idea&mdash;he had struck a bargain with
the man, and he meant to stick to it.  So he held himself
motionless, breathing easily, letting his mind range whither
it would, as he stared in the depths of the stone....
</p>

<p>
He had thought it shallow, and it was unfathomably deep;
clear, and it was opaquely green as sea-water....  And yet
translucent as sea-water can be,&mdash;with smooth swirls and
rounded folds below the jewelled surface&mdash;suggesting veils
wrapped on veils, hiding some mystery....
</p>

<p>
He checked an inclination to yawn.  He was feeling sleepy
and stoggy.  To keep awake he clung to the details of a
certain September evening in 1914.  News had come that day
to the office of the death of young Dannahill,&mdash;and he, John,
had returned by taxi to the family roof-tree, to break to his
mother and his brother Maurice&mdash;Maurice who was now
piloting a Handley-Page bomb-carrier 'plane on the Western
Front&mdash;the news that he, J.B.H.,&mdash;the John of the "Tubs"
Club in Werkeley Street, the John who was a votary of
"Tango" and Progressive Bridge; who talked knowingly of
Russian Ballet, Musical Comedy and smart Revues; the John
whose cherished ambition was to make a pile big enough
to buy Covent Garden and turn it into a Pleasure City to be
run on American lines&mdash;was going to the Front.
</p>

<p>
He&mdash;the said J.B.H., had dined, and was comfortably full,
after the lean weeks of bully beef and rubber-tough Palestine
mutton....  And he had had a deuce of a lot of hock, of
Heidseick Dry Monopole, and three, or was it five Benedictines
with coffee, to take away the bitterness of that over-lauded
Arab stuff....
</p>

<p>
Enough, perhaps, to make an ordinary man squiffy, but
J.B. Hazel was no ordinary man....  In fact, going by
what Essenian Pasha said,&mdash;was that Essenian Pasha
talking? ... Or whose was that voice, mumbling, mumbling....
Not in Arabic, of which John had a smattering, or in
Hebrew&mdash;he knew a little Hebrew&mdash;
</p>

<p>
In whatever language the voice was talking it was trying
to push John over the brink of Things Normal, into the abyss
of Things that are Not.
</p>

<p>
The launch of a battleship at Portsmouth Dockyard,
witnessed years previously, now came vividly back to the
protagonist; a picture thrown by the passing moment upon the
screen of Memory.  As Royalty with mallet and chisel had
severed the cord supporting the bow&mdash;weights, whose fall
knocked away the last dog-shores propping the Dreadnaught,
her vast steel hull had shuddered visibly....  The
thin wind keening through her glassless upper port holes and
along her vast unfitted decks&mdash;gaily beflagged, and speckled
with adventurous human pigmies&mdash;had sounded as though she
wept....  Then a hand had touched an electric stud&mdash;a bottle
in a ribboned net had crashed against the cliff-like bows of
grey-painted steel, figured with Roman numerals&mdash;and the
giant, vibrating from stem to stern, had begun to slide down
the well-greased slipway,&mdash;towards the oily-looking expanse of
chill green water, speckled with floating chips and
orange-peel&mdash;smoking with little drab-white curls of clammy Solent
fog....
</p>

<p>
And John Hazel was the ship ... the sinister, relentless
will that thrust him down must be resisted....  He would
not go! ... Had he not promised somebody called Katharine...
</p>

<p>
Who was Katharine? ... He was rushing to the dreadful
brink....  Without the anticipated shock or jar, he glided
smoothly over....
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"The big Inglizi soldier is very drunk," a Levantine
waiter&mdash;one of a silent group gathered near the dining-room
door, whispered to a comrade behind the shoulder of
Essenian's Mohammedan body-servant.  "Hark, how he snores
behind the screens!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> do not think the <i>tomi</i> drunk," whispered a countryman of
the Levantine's, speaking the same bastard Turkish-Egyptian
dialect.  "For when the Effendim called for sealing-wax I
peeped between the screens, slily, and the Inglizi seemed to me
more like one drugged with the smoke of henbane sprinkled
on the embers of a charcoal fire....  Thus did he sit, with
open eyes, staring into that thing that shines so....  And&mdash;and
the eyes were empty as the eyes of a dead man&mdash;it was
not good to look in them!"
</p>

<p>
"O son of a Maghribi dog!  What is that to thee?" Essenian's
Mohammedan body-servant, who had overheard, hissed
fiercely at the offender.  "Since when hast thou found it good
for thee or thy like to speak of the doings in this house!  My
lord and his guest confer together upon matters too high for
thee.  What has it to do with thee if they practise the <i>es
Semiya?</i>  Do not persons of known probity work magic both
White and Black&mdash;and cast nativities!  Cudgel thy stupid
wits and tell me how long since thou didst stop the clock
there? ... 'An hour-and-a-half....'  Watch now for the
signal! ... When my lord's hand flickers between the screens,
the weight is to be set a-wagging....  Have the <i>ôtomôbilyâ</i>
ready at the door&mdash;the Effendim travels with the Englishman
this night to Ismailia&mdash;I, Yakub Ali, sitting in front with the
<i>wûgâkgi</i> who drives,&mdash;running on the solid earth made by
Allah for the sons of Adam&mdash;instead of flying in the air like
a Jinni of the Jann."

<i>Book the Fourth:</i> THE PASSING
</h2>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
I
</h3>

<p>
In the Central Range of Western Palestine is an ancient
Samaritan township, the Shechem of the Patriarchs.  High
set above shore-level, sheltered by mighty mountains on the
North, East and South, looking down a wady beaten in by-gone
days by the hoofs of the cavalry of Omri,&mdash;rutted by
the silver and ivory chariot-wheels of King Ahab and Queen
Jezebel,&mdash;across low, undulant hill-ranges, to the twenty-mile
distant sea.
</p>

<p>
High set above sea-level, it lies on the floor of a long,
fish-shaped valley, between two towering limestone mountains.
Distant a mile-and-a-half at their summits, their bases nearly
meet.  One is Ebal, the other Gerizim.  They are the mounts
by which the Chosen stood to receive blessings and cursings.
</p>

<p>
The Samaritan Temple, that place of sinister mysteries,
once stood where are now great terebinth-trees, shading the
ruins of an ancient fortress upon Mount Gerizim.  The rock
of their Place of Sacrifice shows its channelled surface above
ground.  To-day, a man standing with the wind at his back,
upon the crown of Ebal or Gerizim and speaking loudly,
would be heard at the summit of the opposite Mount, and in
the streets of the town....
</p>

<p>
The town, upon which the towering limestone heads of Ebal
and Gerizim and their fellows look down sternly, was in its
heyday a place of wealth, where luxury and lust ran riot,
and men and women walked in purple robes, or were carried
in ivory litters; crowned with high jewelled head-dresses, dust
of gold powder lying thick in the spiral curls of their jet black
beards, and the frizzled waves or towering coils of
richly-luxuriant hair.  Now their ancient place of abiding is set about
with ruinous stone mansions, girt with groves of waving
palms, fig-trees, olives and mulberries.  Mean dwellings crowd
on narrow vaulted streets, under whose pavement you can
hear the water rushing.  For there is no lack of water in
Shechem.  The crowded mud Barracks behind the bazar has
a well of pure water in its courtyard.  So cheap is the element
that no one grudges this solace to the prisoners of War.
</p>

<p>
Before the War the chief seat of the Turkish administration
in Palestine, the old town boasted a population of some
25,000 souls.  Thinned by conscription of the younger Jews,
Samaritans, Arabs and native Syrian Christians, it might
have contained some fifteen thousand, counting the garrison
of Turkish infantry officered by monocled and braceleted
Germans,&mdash;when the fortified area of Beersheba fell to the
strategy of Allenby, and the routed left wing of the Fourth
Army Corps of Djemal Pasha, with the formidable motor-driven
siege-guns from the boasted stronghold fell back in
rout and confusion upon the area of Shechem.
</p>

<p>
Some directing Teutonic mind ordained, weeks previous
to the evacuation, that the Allied prisoners from the camps of
Beersheba and its vicinity, packed on Railway cattle-trucks
or Army motor-lorries,&mdash;should be transferred by railway to
the town of Shechem.  It was to be converted by German gold,
forced labour and modern resources, into a stronghold of
Ottoman power, against which the expeditionary army of Britain
should expend itself in vain....
</p>

<p>
There are already British War prisoners in the mud-walled
Barracks at Shechem, built round the courtyard containing
the well.  When on these hunger-gnawed, vermin-ridden men
rolls the flood of human wretchedness from the camps of
Beersheba and its neighbourhood,&mdash;they are to learn the bitter
truth that there are grades in Misery.
</p>

<p>
For a squat, sandy, pale-eyed Lieutenant-General of Turkish
gendarmerie, who acted as Commandant of the Beersheba
prison-camps, now supersedes the tyrant who has ruled at
Shechem.  The inmates of the prisons there have been robbed,
stripped, and beaten.  They have slept in tattered blankets
upon mud or stone floors,&mdash;lived on a daily quarter of a coarse
brown loaf per soul&mdash;and a handful of beans in oil....  They
have undergone insult, and occasionally kicks and blows, but
Home parcels have occasionally reached them, and though
pinched, they were not famished....  Now the parcels are
looted or their contents rendered uneatable....  A loaf is
shared amongst twenty men, the pannikin of boiled beans
yields each a bare spoonful.  Driven out at dawn by Turks
with loaded hide-whips, to dig trenches south and east of the
old fortifications,&mdash;make emplacements for Austro-German
artillery, and lay down a system of interchangeable rails for
the Krupp motor-guns,&mdash;they are herded back at night to the
filthy pens where they are packed so closely that they cannot
lie down to sleep without lying on each other.  Whence in
the mornings men suffocated by the press of the bodies of
their comrades are taken out dead....
</p>

<p>
These victims belong to the rank and file.  Some officers
are quartered in the old stone-built prison.  Yet others live
in Turkish Army tents in a barbed-wire enclosure at the
eastern end of the town.  A ramshackle hut serves as their
mess, when they have anything to mess on.  But they are not
too crowded for decency, and sickness spares them.  Presently
the officers are drafted away, four only remaining,&mdash;and
the congestion at the mud-built Barracks is somewhat
relieved.  But Hunger, Overcrowding and Dirt have bred
Dysentery, septic skin-eruptions and Typhus Fever, and these
claim their victims by the score.
</p>

<p>
The Hospital near the new Turkish Barracks by the
Arsenal, staffed by the German Red Cross and the nurses and
orderlies of the Red Crescent,&mdash;being crowded with Turkish
and German wounded&mdash;cannot admit more than a few of
the gravest cases of dysentery.  The typhus patients are
removed to the Hospital under the auspices of the Established
Church of England Missionary Society, and another,&mdash;devotedly
tended by the Catholic Sisters of the Cross.  Helpers
come from the Mission House of the Latin Patriarchate, who
unweariedly give their services wherever there is need....
But desperate indeed would be the plight of the War
prisoners&mdash;save that through the blizzard of misery raging through
the mud Barracks&mdash;the courage and charity of one man shine
like a steadfast star....
</p>

<p>
The man is a Catholic chaplain who has served with the
Expeditionary Forces at Gallipoli; has been taken prisoner
and kept for awhile in Hospital at Constantinople; has been
drafted to Smyrna, and later, by such haphazard chance as
governs the lives of prisoners, has been shifted to Beersheba,
and thence to Shechem.
</p>

<p>
Unweariedly he alleviates, whilst sharing, the common
misery.  Shaking with fever, hunger-bitten to the bone, ragged
as any scarecrow, red-eyed with sleeplessness, he moves from
room to room distributing such poor comforts as are
obtainable.  Helping the convalescent, ministering to the sick,
dispensing the Sacraments of the Mother Church to the Catholic
dying&mdash;cheering those of other creeds with the words that
are of God....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On a day in November, half-an-hour later than the morning
prayer-call from the minaret of the Great Mosque that was
once a Church of the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre&mdash;you
are to see Father Julian Forbis going his daily round....  The
mud-walled courtyard is closed in on three sides by the
mud-built Barracks, and on the fourth by a high wall topped by
rusty iron spikes&mdash;a wall in which there is an archway closed
by a double gate, flanked on either side by guard-rooms.  Over
the gateway is the office of the Turkish Commandant.
</p>

<p>
To-day the courtyard of the mud-built Barracks is full
of sunshine and packed with prisoners.  Lying, squatting or
standing, the majority are squalid spectres on whose gaunt
frames their foul and tattered clothing hangs baggily, though
some are bloated like the corpses of men who have been
long drowned.  Though the assemblage is sprinkled with
Roumanians, Syrians, Jews, Armenians and Arabs,&mdash;these last
having a dungeon to themselves, of unutterable filthiness, the
bulk are of the rank and file of Britain's Crusading Forces.
Australians, Indians, New Zealanders, and British
Territorials....  Actors, clerks, printers, shopwalkers and jockeys;
farm-labourers, electricians, gardeners, photographers, bakers,
University students,&mdash;representatives of every class and
calling.  One and all strung to endurance by the spirit that makes
heroes of ordinary men....
</p>

<p>
The shadows of Ebal and Gerizim as yet fall westward.
Their towering summits and those of the lesser mountains, and
the minarets of the Great and the two smaller mosques look
down into the dirty mud-walled court, baking in the rays of
the early sun, though the November nights are chilly.  Every
stench the prison fosters seems intensified by the heat.  The
loud buzzing of millions of flies mingles in a bagpipe-drone
with the noise of many voices, Eastern and European,&mdash;talking
in half-a-dozen languages and a hundred dialects&mdash;and
the hubbub has for its accompaniment the thudding of distant
guns.  From the southwest, where the 54th British Division is
engaged with the enemy between the sea and Gaza.  Nearer
South, where a bitter struggle is being waged by British
Cavalry, armoured cars, and the bombers and machine-gunners
of the Royal Flying Corps, for the possession of Junction
Station&mdash;the next point after the fall of Gaza, of tactical
importance in Palestine.  From the hills towards Hebron those
enemy forces, who have previously retreated to this vantage,
have descended into the Coastal Plain, to relieve the pressure
and stiffen the resistance of their comrades by demonstrating
a counter-attack.  For if Junction Station, the key of the
northern railway-system, with its vast dumps of rolling-stock,
supplies, War-material and its camps of prisoners, shall fall
into the hands of the British&mdash;Jerusalem will be cut off from
communication save by Wireless with Turkey and Germany....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Day wears apace....  The winged hordes of Baal Zebub,
like the humans whom they feast on, are making the most of
the sunshine.  Fat white maggots that will be flies presently,&mdash;and
vermin still more loathsome&mdash;crawl in the dirty straw
on which the prisoners are squatting or lying.  Deep in the
well the clear water shines like a huge blue eye, reflecting the
shadowless heavens above.
</p>

<p>
A man hanging over, seems to stare in the water, apparently
sheltering his eyes with both hands from the glare.  He has
the crowned wings of the R.F.C. on the shoulder of his ragged
shirt of khaki flannel, and the clear water of the brimming well
reflects the three chevrons and crown of a Flight Sergeant,
tacked upon its tattered sleeve.  Also the glittering lenses of
a small pair of folding binoculars, cunningly concealed by the
curve of their owner's hands.
</p>

<p>
"What be 'ee lookin' vor, Tom?" cautiously whispers a
freckled trooper of Devon Yeomanry, digging a painfully
sharp elbow in the airman's lean ribs.
</p>

<p>
Barney Mossam takes it on himself to answer,&mdash;being the
accredited wit and jester of the knot gathered about the well.
He is a little, broad-shouldered, bow-legged London Territorial,
with a nose that has suffered in bouts of fisticuffs; a
carroty head, a broad humorous grin, and a squint that points
a joke.  He speaks with the thick catarrhal snuffle of the East
End.  Even in khaki his type proclaims him of the Race of
Costermongers....  Covent Garden Market is thick with
Barneys, all alike as peas from the pod....
</p>

<p>
"Ticklebats, my flash top," says Barney winking, "kind you
used to ketch a while back, wiv' a bottle tied on a string."  He
adds in a thick whisper directed at the ear of the absorbed
Flight Sergeant, "Wot d'yer pipe, old Sky-gazer?  Thinkin'
it's abaht time we 'ad another look-in from ours affectionately
the Two-Faced Nightingale?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  Unless he happened to come in the night!"  The
cautious whisper of the reply only just reaches the ears for
which it is intended....
</p>

<p>
"I 'eard a 'plane go singin' over 'ere 'bout twelve-thirty by
my gold ticker," says Barney.  "But she was one of them there
seaplanes wiv' little canoes instid o' wheels.  There ain't so
many 'Un 'planes abaht as there used to!&mdash;an' Turkey 'planes
is gittin' as rare as&mdash;as glass in the Strand an' Covent Garden
Market&mdash;after the bloomin' Zepps and Super Goths 'as paid
the usual mornin' call...."  His thick whisper is barely
audible even to the other: "Reckon that's why it pays Old
Two-Face to play the double game.  Wiv' a patent trick
lever-switch&mdash;Gorblime 'im!&mdash;but 'e's clever! to cover the Union
Jacks on 'is under-wings with Red Crescents when 'e tips
the stud....  'Wish <i>I</i> 'ad a Turk face to pull over my reel
one!  Wouldn't take me long to 'op out of 'ere!  Wonder if
'e 'as the syme dodge fitted on 'is top wings?  Give one o' my
last three fags&mdash;I would!&mdash;to find out 'oo 'e is!"
</p>

<p>
"He's not an Englishman, thank God!  He's pretty nearly
a black one.  Dark as a Gyppo&mdash;or a Hindu.  The other was
white.  Inside as well as out.  <i>That's</i> why he was murdered!"
returns the Flight Sergeant in his wary whisper, without
lowering his hands....
</p>

<p>
"Some blokes gits all the fun.  'Ow come you to see it,
Sergeant?"
</p>

<p>
For once the Cockney's jest provokes no appreciative smile.
The thin hands sheltering the prized binoculars shake....
The whispering voice shakes also&mdash;and its hurried sentences
are punctuated by the thudding of those distant guns....
</p>

<p>
"I've told you....  It's just a week since....  I was up
in our room there," the speaker contemptuously jerks his ear
towards an upper window of one of the Barrack buildings&mdash;"looking
through this little Zeiss glass that magnifies by 20.
(I've told you how I took it off a dead German airman at
Huy.) ...  And the Two-Faced Nightingale&mdash;hovering not
more than four hundred feet above the Square in front of
the big Khan,&mdash;was picking the place, damn him! where he'd
settled to drop his despatch-bag.  He switched his Red
Crescents on over the Union Jacks&mdash;and the stunt brought the
usual roar of laughter from the people.  Every one was out
to stare,&mdash;the streets as far as I could see, were packed, as
well as the roofs....  Then he dropped his bag, plumb for
the square,&mdash;swung round and steered Southward.  And,&mdash;keeping
the glasses focussed on them, I saw his white observer
stand up, lean forward and touch him on the back.  He looked
round and his white teeth flashed in his face sort of
spitefully....  The other fellow was handing him out cold truth
in ladlefuls, shaking his fist and raving like mad.  Then&mdash;it
happened before you could wipe an eye!  He&mdash;the pilot&mdash;cut
out his engine&mdash;turned round, and I caught the glitter of a
revolver in his hand.  Then came the flash and the crack.
And the white man buckled up in the bottom of his
cockpit&mdash;and the Two-Faced Nightingale switched on and flew away
South.  And nothing was left on the blue sky but a puff of
brown cordite."
</p>

<p>
"The murderin' dawg!"  Barney carefully moves from the
coping-stone of the well a burnt match, and a wisp of straw,
that some eddying draught of the hot breeze might carry into
the water.  "No fear of 'im gittin' copped.  This 'ere queer go
wot we calls Life's more on the lines of a Drury Lyne Autumn
Show than I twigged when I rallied up 'long o' my pals on
Fust Nights outside the good old Gallery Entrance.  On'y it's
turned the wrong w'y raound.  Vice gits all the limes from
both wings, an' all the clappin' from the Pit an' Gallery.  An'
Virtue kips on the bare boards of a stinkin' Turkish barrack-room,
or 'unkers in the stinkin' mud, and 'unts things wot
'ops and crawls."  He goes on, talking to himself, for the
airman, staring in the reflected patch of sky is suddenly absorbed
to deafness.  "S'trewth!  Wherever it does pay&mdash;off of the
boards of a Theayter&mdash;the 'Eroic Line don't go for nuts&mdash;not
'ere in Palestine!"
</p>

<p>
"Ye are richt!  It pays nae better than it paid twa thousan'
years agone.  But which is it better to be on&mdash;the de'il's
side&mdash;or the Lord's?  I wuss to Him some voice frae Heaven wad
speyk an' answer me! ..."
</p>

<p>
The utterance&mdash;unmistakably Scotch&mdash;breaks in several feet
above the level of Barney's monologue.  He looks up at a tall,
gaunt, red-haired Scot in the Border bonnet and ragged khaki
kilt, and badges of the Tweedburgh Regiment, and says with
his characteristic wink:
</p>

<p>
"'Ullo, Corp'ral Govan!  Thet you? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Nae ither that I ken...."  He is quite young, but he
moves like an old man, as he lets his long length slowly down
on the mud beside the Cockney, unheeding the invitation to
take a straw, and hugs his hairy knees.  "Man!  I wad gie the
twa dirrty Turkish notes in ma pooch, an' a guid British florin
to the back o' them, to be anither chap than Alec Govan the
day.  For I have seen what a man may scarce see, an' keep his
brain frae madness&mdash;ay! an' his tongue from cryin' oot on
God!"  He rocks himself in silence, then says with a stifled
groan: "Man! dinna gawp at me.  Do ye no' ken I hae been
wi' Ullathorne? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ullathorne.  That's your chum, ain't 'e?  Wot abaht 'im?"
</p>

<p>
"Hae ye no' heird?"  The long Scot stares at the Cockney
wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Nuffin' but that 'e didn't come back last night wiv the
workin'-party.  'As 'e turned up?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  They pitched him back intil oor room last nicht&mdash;a'
the green rods had left o' him.  Weel I kenned they would
do their warst once they got their chance."  There is foam
on the livid lips.  "They drove him oot wi' the rest o' us to
the Defence Warks yesterday mornin', though he had the fever
on him sair, an' couldna' stand alane....  Weel, weel I wat
why!"  He is shaking as though with ague.  "An' he staggered
an' reeled, an' knocked up against ane o' the sentries&mdash;an'
Hamid Bey was standing by wi' some of his gang o'
police....  By the grin on the pasty face of him, ye could
tell he was oot for murder.  An' he ordered Ullathorne a
hundred strokes for brutally attackin' the man.  They held us
up an' made us watch whiles they laid on to him.  O Christ
Jesus! ... First on the feet, twenty-five strokes&mdash;then the
back an' belly an' breist....  An' when he fainted an' lay for
dead, they drove us oot wi' their whips an' left him lyin'; an'
when we came back for the nicht-shift he was gane awa' from
there....  In the mirk o' the nicht, as I hae said, they flung
him in amang us,&mdash;nakit as a new-born wean&mdash;an' his raw
flesh hangin' in strips.  As though the butcher had stairted to
collop him&mdash;an' changed his min' aboot it.  A braw sicht for
the mither that bore him, an' the lass he should hae wed!"
</p>

<p>
"Gorblime the bloody beasts!" says Barney, gulping.  His
coarse hand touches the thin arm in the tattered sleeve with the
Corporal's stripes, and does it gently too.  "Will Ullathorne
live?  They don't often live&mdash;our own chaps&mdash;do 'em?&mdash;though
Turks seems some'ow diff'rent."
</p>

<p>
"He was deein' when they broucht him back, puir lad!
I hae left him barely breathin'....  Father Forbis is wi' him
noo....  Ullathorne is nae no Catholic, but the Father has
the Gift o' the Word.  Sune&mdash;sune he will be dead, my chum
that I made at Gallipoli, the last o' the auld company left
aiblins mysel'!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No tears come to the burning grey eyes that stare into
vacancy.
</p>

<p>
"A' nicht I held him i' my airms!  His bluid is wet upo'
me.  An' I made a sang to sooth to him&mdash;we Govans aye had
the bard's gift, they say, in the braw auld days.  And when
he is dead&mdash;for I promised him!&mdash;the haill Barracks shall
hear't.  The bonny sang o' the Christian men killed by the
Turkish hound!"
</p>

<p>
"Look wide O!  One o' them Mo'ammedan guards 'as got
'is ugly eye on you," urges Barney, apprehensive that the
recklessness of grief may bring Govan the fate of his friend.
"While there's life there's 'ope! ... Pre'aps Ullathorne
might git round yit!"
</p>

<p>
But Govan shakes his haggard head:
</p>

<p>
"I doot&mdash;I doot it sairly.  But what can be done Father
Forbis will dae.  He promised me he wouldna leave him as
lang as there was breith i' him.  An' Forbis aye keeps his
word.  Here he comes!  Luik at's face..... Ullathorne has
passed to his Maker!"
</p>

<p>
The Scot starts to his naked feet, and Barney Mossam sits
up and salutes, as through an archway on the ground-floor
of the sordid block of buildings opposite comes the figure of
a tall, emaciated man, followed by a burly, slovenly Turkish
soldier and a grotesque, hunchbacked shape,&mdash;recognisable
only by the voluminous folds of the coarse biscuit-coloured
veil that covers its head, and falls to the hem of its soiled
blue cotton robe&mdash;as a Syrian peasant woman.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Mossam!"  The intonations of the priest's
voice, and the smile that curves the mouth hidden by the
reddish-golden beard, and lights the sunken blue eyes, are very
like Katharine's....  "You are up and about again! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't lay up in the lap o' luxury no longer, Father!"
drolls the indomitable jester.  "A man in my condition 'as to
'ave exercise to sweat the suet off 'is bones."
</p>

<p>
The bones show as though the tattered uniform hung on
clothes-props.  The priest glances at them compassionately,
and then with gentle friendliness at the haggard faces that
turn to him, as he picks his way delicately between the prone
and squatting men.
</p>

<p>
"Move!" says the Turkish military guard in the greenish-yellow
khaki served out to the Ottoman forces in the War
with Serbia, a huge <i>posta</i> whose fez sits on the extreme summit
of his pointed head like the red-paper-cap on a bottle of
liquorice-powder,&mdash;who wears good boots stripped from a
British prisoner: and who speaks a bastard mixture of bad
Turkish and worse Arabic: "<i>Haide git</i>!  Make way for the
<i>kassis</i> and the woman!  <i>Imshi</i>!  Must ye be as the beasts?"
</p>

<p>
For a hyæna-like yell of joy has greeted the discovery that
there are oranges in one, and almonds and walnuts in the
other, of two heavy palm-fibre baskets carried by the
misshapen, limping being who follows behind the priest.  The
wretched creature is one of those nondescript hangers-on that
in the negligent East haunt such places of misery as the mud
Barrack-prison,&mdash;gaining a meagre subsistence by washing the
prisoners' tattered linen, running errands to the <i>bâzâr</i>,&mdash;boiling
broth or carrying water for the sick and convalescent, and,
when the guards can be bribed into acquiescence&mdash;washing and
laying out the bodies of the dead.
</p>

<p>
Bundled in her soiled rags&mdash;shrouded in the voluminous veil
that hides a face so disfigured by accident or disease, that no
European who has glimpsed can think of it without a shudder,
and Orientals express their abhorrence by spitting on
the ground&mdash;the Mother of Ugliness&mdash;thus nicknamed by some
coarse wit among her countrymen&mdash;passes without insult,
ill-usage or outrage, where no other of her sex, unprotected by
deformity and hideousness, could have escaped....
</p>

<p>
"Orangees.  Glory be to God!&mdash;an' where did yer Reverence
git thim?" asks the owner of the unmistakably Irish voice,
stretching gaunt hands, shaking with fever, for one of the
luscious golden globes.
</p>

<p>
"A friend brought them," briefly answers the priest, as he
distributes the fruit and nuts generously on all sides.
</p>

<p>
"God bless the friend! ... An' that's yourself, I'm
thinkin'," grunts the Irishman, driving his teeth deep into
the juicy fruit.
</p>

<p>
"No, Sullivan, it was not I.  You see the giver...."
</p>

<p>
"The Mother av' Ugliness, bedad!  More power to her!"
splutters Sullivan, as the priest points to the crooked shape
swathed in its sordid veils.
</p>

<p>
"She has earned a prettier name here among us," says Father
Forbis, looking round at the faces,&mdash;pinched and white,
or livid, or fever-flushed, that crowd about him, and speaking
with mild authority.  "She shall be called henceforth The
Mother of Kindness...."
</p>

<p>
He turns to the shrinking creature at his heels and repeats
it in Arabic.
</p>

<p>
"Sidi!" the woman implores in muffled tones, trembling so
that the folds of her coarse veils wave as though some vagrant
breeze were stirring amongst them:
</p>

<p>
"I have spoken!  By you and other British in this place&mdash;"  He
looks round sternly at the men, "the old name is forgotten.
She is the Mother of Kindness....  Let all of you remember
that!"
</p>

<p>
"We'll not forgit, yer Reverence! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Verra weel, Sirr! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Sure we'll remember, Boss! ..."
</p>

<p>
"A' right, Sir!                                                                     ..."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Han, Hâzrât!</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
"Right O Father! ..."
</p>

<p>
"A'ay, Zur, for sure! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Yea, verily, it shall be as the Sahib orders!"
</p>

<p>
They answer him in a hundred voices, resonant bass, or
cheery tenor, coarse and refined, illiterate or educated,&mdash;flavoured
with the accent and in the dialect of every shire or
county in the United Kingdom&mdash;every country of the Dominions
Overseas.  And standing in his ragged clothes, with a
battered enamelled can of broth and another of barley-water
dangling from one lean hand, while the other eases the heavy
weight of a wallet of canvas, broad, slung about his thin
shoulders, and containing such medicines and dressings as may
be had&mdash;the Father surveys them smilingly&mdash;but with the
spark in his blue eyes that they know can leap to flame....
</p>

<p>
You are to see him as a tall, emaciated man of twenty-nine
or thirty, chalky-pale with famine and worn with lack of
sleep.  Eagle-featured, broad-browed, blue-eyed; with long,
untrimmed hair and tangled beard of ruddy yellow-brown.
Without the eight-pointed black metal star on the lapel of his
tattered khaki jacket, or the wisp of Roman collar that still
hangs about his neck, or the bartered Breviary and Office book
that bulges a front tunic-pocket&mdash;a ragged strip of purple stole
between its well-thumbed pages&mdash;you could not fail to recognise
the Religious by vocation; the cultured priest, the man
born to dominate, sway and rule.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Haide</i>!  Let us go!" growls the Turkish guard, thrusting
two oranges and a handful of nuts in a pocket of his soiled
tunic, and kicking a man squatting in his path less viciously
than as a matter of form.
</p>

<p>
And the little procession of the tall priest, the red-fezzed
guard, and the bundle of soiled feminine clothing&mdash;brought up
in the rear by Corporal Alec Govan, moves towards the
ground-floor archway on the other side of the courtyard.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0402"></a></p>

<h3>
II
</h3>

<p>
"Sirr!"
</p>

<p>
"You, Govan? ..."  The priest glances back as he passes
out of the sunshine and smells of the courtyard into the
squalor and reek of the fetid passage, and the guard, kicking
out a palm-wood stool from behind the heavy wooden-locked
door, squats down upon it to crack and eat nuts....
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Sirr....  It is a' ower? ..."
</p>

<p>
The priest gravely bends his head, and the red light in
Govan's eyes is momentarily quenched in bitter waters, as he
goes on, gulping his agony down:
</p>

<p>
"I weel kent that was sae, or ye wad no' have left him.
Did he no' speyk ane worr'd o' his mither, puir cratur!&mdash;or o'
the lass he bude to marry&mdash;or o' me, his frien'&mdash;before he
passed?"
</p>

<p>
"He spoke of one Friend&mdash;just at the last&mdash;even a better
one than you were," says Father Forbis, gently touching the
man's clenched hand.  "He Who was scourged by Roman rods
for poor Ullathorne and you, and all of us.  Who died that
we might live with Him for all eternity.  Where Death
cannot come&mdash;or cruelty&mdash;or suffering...."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Sirr....  Ye are verra gude.  We a' ken that o' ye!"
</p>

<p>
"And God is good," says the priest, "though Man may make
men doubt it.  Where are you going? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I am ganging back to Ullathorne.  He maun be washed an'
straikit an' berrit dacently.  He maunna be pitched intil a hole
like a doug!"
</p>

<p>
The priest shudders and his face contracts painfully.
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  You shall have what little linen I can find,
and all the help I can spare....  I must finish my rounds
among the sick men now....  But, Govan! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ay! ..."
</p>

<p>
"In the name of the old friendly days&mdash;"  The thin but powerful
white hand goes out and rests on the other's shoulder,&mdash;"when
you and I&mdash;two long-legged lads&mdash;tickled trout in the
Rushet and went rabbiting on the high moors&mdash;and made toffee
over the stove in the harness-room at Kerr's Arbour&mdash;and for
your own sake and the sakes of all here!&mdash;let me beg you not
to provoke the evil man who has us in his power, by a rash
display of the wrath and scorn that can do no good&mdash;to him!"
</p>

<p>
"Meanin' Ullathorne!  I hear ye, Sirr."  A strange smile
shows on the grimly-set mouth, and the dour grey eyes sullenly
shun the appeal of the blue ones.  "Wi' your leave I will
be ganging back to him the now....  He aye likit me to make
queer sangs to sooth to him in the lang hoors when we lay
in the trenches at Gallipoli.  An' I hae a sang&mdash;the queerest
ane o' a'&mdash;he wad fell like to hear!  Guid day to ye, Sirr!"
</p>

<p>
He salutes, with the strange smile fixed upon his face, wheels
about, and strides out of the fetid passage-way back into the
sunshine, and the priest's heart sinks within him as he goes.
Fresh furrows line his high, white brow, and anxiety deepens
the caves about his eyes, as he says&mdash;speaking in Arabic to
the bowed figure waiting humbly as a dog at the bottom of
the broken staircase:
</p>

<p>
"He is mad with grief.  God pity him! ... Follow, and
give what aid thou canst, O Mother of Kindness!"
</p>

<p>
"If the Sidi would graciously&mdash;not call me by that
name...."
</p>

<p>
The timid whisper barely reaches the ear it was meant for.
They have moved farther down the murky, fetid passage-way,
blocked at its entrance by the burly body of the nut-cracking
Turkish guard.  Father Forbis asks in surprise:
</p>

<p>
"Why not, when thou dost merit it? ..."  And she answers:
</p>

<p>
"Sidi, in ugliness there is Protection!  Could a woman&mdash;with
two eyes and a whole face&mdash;instead of a half-one&mdash;dwell
in this evil place one hour&mdash;and fare forth unharmed? ..."  She
makes as though to pull aside her veil with her dusky,
slender fingers, but does not, and goes on in the same swift
cautious undertone:
</p>

<p>
"True, there are British soldiers here, and nearly all that
I have met were respecters of decent women!  But when even
the British soldiers are beaten and tortured&mdash;made the sport
of devils in forms of men!&mdash;what can avail a woman better
than to be hideous?  Sidi,&mdash;if a Turk thrust forth a hand to
pluck aside my veil, he&mdash;he!" she chuckles with a dry, clacking,
mirthlessness, "see you&mdash;he retches and spits and curses&mdash;and
does not do it again!  <i>Shâf&mdash;Shâf!</i> ... See, O see!"
</p>

<p>
She pulls the veil ruthlessly from the left side of her hidden
face and shows to the priest's pitying eyes the ruin it has
concealed.  The scar of an old burn puckers the olive-tinted
temple and cheek that have caved where the bone has been
shattered&mdash;the blinded eye has vanished under ridged folds of
skin.  The bridge of the nose&mdash;enough left of it to show that
the feature has been of the curved Semitic type&mdash;has been
ruthlessly shattered;&mdash;the upper lip, torn partly away, has
healed into shapelessness....  He does not see the other
side of the face&mdash;and the woman evinces no desire to show it.
But the little ear, daintily formed and shaded by hair that is
yet jet-black and silken&mdash;shows that the Mother of Ugliness
may once have been beautiful....
</p>

<p>
"A gunshot wound&mdash;and a terrible one."  He says it to
himself ponderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Sidi.  The weapon was a revolver."
</p>

<p>
"What say you? ..."
</p>

<p>
The priest starts.  He has spoken his thought in his English
tongue, and this Syrian woman has answered in her own.  And
it is the Arabic of the cultured classes, not the peasants'
primitive speech.  He looks at her, and she draws her veil over the
poor ruined face that may once have been lovely and goes on
speaking in her cultured Arabic:
</p>

<p>
"Verily, Sidi!  A revolver-shot, fired so near that the muzzle
touched the skin.  There was little time&mdash;"  She gives her
dry, rustling chuckle.  "Little time, and he wished to make
sure.  He did not mean to miss! ..."
</p>

<p>
"A heartless crime, O woman!  But thou dost forgive the
doer?"
</p>

<p>
"He was not mine enemy!" she says with her mirthless
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Thy lover....  And jealous....  Forgive him all the
more for that having loved&mdash;he hurt thee in his frenzy.  This
was" (of course, the woman is old) "done many years ago?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, Sidi!  When I was young."  Her laugh is like the
crackling of burning brush....  "Three years ago&mdash;no longer!
And he who did the thing was my brother, not my lover," says
the flat, toneless voice from within the folds of the veil.  "And
jealous truly&mdash;but for his sister's honour.  He dared not slay
mine enemy&mdash;a <i>Zabit</i> of the <i>Osmanli</i>,&mdash;for that would have
brought sword and fire and destruction upon our house.  My
lord understands? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Surely!"
</p>

<p>
"Therefore he gave me the wound thou seest&mdash;and thinking
he had killed me,&mdash;he shot himself to escape death by
torture and degradation.  May God reward him a
thousand-fold in the bosom of Abraham! ..."
</p>

<p>
The priest starts slightly:
</p>

<p>
"Thou art a Jewess?"
</p>

<p>
She is silent....
</p>

<p>
"Or perhaps a Samaritaness, like that woman of this city,
who near two thousand years ago held drink to the parched
lips of a Traveller beside Jacob's Well?"
</p>

<p>
"What I once was does not matter, but I am no
Samaritaness!"  There is something like resentment in the faded,
toneless voice.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art Charity's very daughter to the sick ones in this
prison.  For one para that they give thee, they get ten piastres
back.  Dost thou think that I am blind?"  Smiling, he shakes
his finger at the Mother of Ugliness.  She bows her head and
answers, trembling like a reed in the wind:
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Sidi....  I have feared not! ... But for the love
of Him Whom thou dost serve&mdash;seem to be blind a little
longer!  There is" (another spasm of trembling passes through
her)&mdash;"There is no medicine for the wretched like helping
Wretchedness!  Here I am somewhat....  They do not
shrink from me.  Me whom the children in the streets hoot
and run from!&mdash;at whose hidden face the women in the doorways
spit and point their amulets, lest its influence blight
before birth the unborn babe in the womb!  And&mdash;were I driven
from this place&mdash;"  The faint voice is silent:
</p>

<p>
"Be it so, O Mother of Ugliness!  Henceforth I am dumb
as to thy virtues, and blind to the beauty of&mdash;thy deeds!
Come&mdash;and I will give thee some linen for the swathing of that
poor broken body that was a live man yesterday.  What ails
Thee, O woman?  What dost thou fear? ..."
</p>

<p>
For the bowed figure crouches down, shaking as though
with ague, a mere heap of sordid clothes on the filthy floor at
his feet.  A stifled voice falters out:
</p>

<p>
"Didst thou not hear the bugle? ... The gates&mdash;the gates
are opening! ..."
</p>

<p>
They are, indeed, with a clanking of rusty iron bolts in
stone groovings; with a turning out of the slovenly guard
from the bare rooms flanking the high archway of the gate.
With a stiff uprising of the lolling, nut-cracking <i>posta</i> at the
doorway&mdash;a susurrous of fierce whispers&mdash;a nameless commotion
of hate and fear and loathing unutterable&mdash;amongst the
packed bodies of the prisoners squatting, standing, or lying
on the beaten mud pavement of the prison courtyard....
</p>

<p>
"The Bey!"  The thick whisper reaches the priest and the
woman, flung over the shoulder of the Turk as he stands at
attention in the doorway: "Hamid Bey Mutasarrif comes,
bringing a Mushir of the Almanis to inspect the prisoners...."  He
adds, under his hurried breath: "Allah and the
Prophet of Allah be with me, Hasan Ali&mdash;and deliver me from
smitings this unpropitious day!"
</p>

<p>
The guard have turned out.  They raggedly present arms,
and Hasan Ali, and such others of his fellows as are on duty
in the courtyard&mdash;or posted at the portals of the mud
Barrack-buildings&mdash;shoulder their Sniders or more modern Remingtons
with the smartness engendered of fear; as a squat, sandy
officer of Turkish gendarmerie&mdash;topped with the ugly khaki
compromise between the turban and the helmet&mdash;patented by
Envey Bey in 1912&mdash;and adorned as to the epaulettes with the
two stars, and as to the cuffs with the four longitudinal gold
lace bands and the three diagonal gold bars of a Turkish
Lieutenant General&mdash;walks with a tall, brick-faced&mdash;very
much decorated German Staff officer, in amongst the stenches
of the crowded prison-yard.
</p>

<p>
Several persons succeed these.  Two German Staff officers
of inferior rank to the first, evidently his <i>aide</i>, and a secretary,
come swaggering and chatting behind their Chief.  A bearded
Turkish Surgeon Major, fat and apoplectic, in black gauze
spectacles, waddles after&mdash;with a nondescript Greek person,
evidently of the interpreter-class.  And a half-company of
Turkish mounted gendarmerie troop after, rather stragglingly.
The big bushy-bearded, red-fezzed men, uniformed in old-time
dark blue Hussar tunics, with orange and black facings,
braided pantaloons and long shiny thigh-boots, are all
well-armed with Winchester repeating-rifles, and carry big
German Service revolvers in holsters at their belts.
</p>

<p>
There is a dull shuffling sound, mingled with thuds and
stifled swearing, as the Turkish guards, with assiduous kicks,
and blows of the rifle-butt, assist sitting or lying War
prisoners to assume a perpendicular position; and herd their
charges into rank right and left, leaving a central avenue down
which the Bey and the visitors may pass.  Holding his breath
in an agony of suspense as he peers into the crowded courtyard
over the broad shoulder of the soldier blocking the passage,
the priest scans the faces that he knows for signs of
coming storm.  As the squat, pale-eyed, bow-legged Asiatic,
uniformed in greenish khaki-drill, wearing with clownish
awkwardness the wide-thighed riding-breeches, the belts, pouches,
and gauntlets of russet leather, and the polished riding boots
with silver spurs, that set off the tall soldierly figures of the
Germans, steps with them across the threshold of the prison
courtyard it seems to every prisoner that the very sunshine
fails of its warmth, and the faint hot breeze blows cold....
</p>

<p>
The Bey looks about him with a pale oblique slyness, his
cigarette elaborately poised between his thick gloved fingers,
and says, speaking in Turkish, (which language the priest,
held for months in durance vile at Constantinople and at
Smyrna, has relieved the tedium of prison-life by studying,
and fairly understands):
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, my children!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, O Bey! ... May Allah favour your Excellency,"
lustily chorus the <i>postas</i>.  But at the sound of the
hated voice the faces of the prisoners have darkened threateningly,
and the silence that falls on the tainted enclosure is
heavy as a pall.
</p>

<p>
"Your Excellency wished to inspect the British men before
seeing the British officers.  These guests of our Empire"&mdash;Hamid's
leering smile and the glitter in his pale flat eyes
show the Bey's enjoyment of his own sarcasm, and the stiff
faces of the German general and his <i>aides-de-camp</i> and secretary
exhibit a faint grin as he continues: "&mdash;these guests of
our Empire are not at work to-day....  It is a holiday for
them.  They sit and chat and eat fruit," (his sharp glance has
lighted on the scattered nutshells and orange-peel), "and smoke
tobacco about the well in their courtyard.  Your Excellency
sees!&mdash;a capital well! ... Praise be to Allah for the blessing
of pure water!  Show the well to his Excellency....  Make
room, O you there! ..."
</p>

<p>
A gap being made in the ragged ranks by <i>postas</i> with the
rifle-butt, the brick-faced German general stalks to the low
parapet of the sky-reflecting eye of clear water, and
pronounces it in Turkish of the Prussian brand, to be an
exceedingly good well.  The Bey, pretending to look at it too,
enriches the water with his chewed cigarette-end; and spits in
it slyly behind the back of the German general&mdash;to the
chuckling delight of his immediate following&mdash;and the more
controlled amusement of the German <i>aide-de-camp</i> and
secretary.  As for the Greek interpreter and the fat be-goggled
Surgeon Major, whose pharmacopæia is limited to Epsom
Salts, pills of a rending nature, sulphur and iodine; who knows
no disinfectant beyond chloride of lime, and never heard of
sterilisation; whose surgical equipment is limited to a saw
or two, some needles, a scalpel&mdash;all beyond words unclean!&mdash;lint
made by Turkish ladies in secluded harems; sticking-plaster
of the most adhesive kind, splints and First Aid bandages,
these two parasites fairly wallow in enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
The dirty bit of buffoonery is such a success that Hamid Bey
is about to repeat it, when a heavy blow upon some dense,
non-reverberating surface arrests him in the act.  He starts, and
looks round for the offender.  So do the German officers,
though their hard eyes are expressionless, and their sunburned
faces as blank as brown tiles.  So do the parasites, so do the
military police of the Bey's escort, and the <i>postas</i> of the guard.
Then as the dull, pounding blow is repeated on the sill of
a second-floor window of the mud wing facing the entrance-gates
of the courtyard, every eye rolls up to there expectantly
and men hold their breath.
</p>

<p>
Crash! ... The weapon falls again....  It is the leg of a
wooden stool, gripped in a fist that is strong and hairy ...
and a face&mdash;unmistakably a madman's now!&mdash;appears at the
window above.  And in the hush that falls upon the parched
courtyard, a crazy voice begins to sing&mdash;the leg of the stool
coming down with a terrific crash at the end of every line:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Say, ye Deid that hae gane before us!<br>
  (Mithers too, that conceived an' bore us,<br>
  Prayin' at hame an' greetin' for us&mdash;)<br>
  <i>What for the Hound wi' the jaws that tore us?&mdash;<br>
  What for the Turkish Hound?</i><br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What for the beast that killed Tom Warren?<br>
  Nichols, Greenbough, Smith and Beeching,<br>
  Austin, Frenchard, Lark and Mansur&mdash;<br>
  <i>Hear ye no their voices answer&mdash;<br>
  'Hell to the Turkish Hound!'</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The storm has broken with a vengeance.  But even the
white-faced priest, peering over the unsteady shoulder of the
scared Turkish soldier, is carried away by the tingling
excitement of the thing.  Knowing that the gates of Terror are
burst open&mdash;and that Vengeance shall issue forth....
</p>

<p>
Upon the wild, discoloured face with the glaring eyes, all
other eyes are glued expectantly, as through the rictus of a
dreadful laugh that is stamped upon it by Insanity, it sings
to the wild droning tune&mdash;to the accompaniment of the wooden
club upon the crumbling window-sill&mdash;its rhymeless hymn of
hate.  Faces nearly as ghastly as the singer's appear at and
crowd the windows of the Barracks.  And in time to the crazy
chant; the crazy buildings, the mud-walled and paved
courtyard begin to shake with the measured stamping of the
prisoners naked feet:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "What for the Man that made of Arthur,<br>
  Thomas, Chauncey, Dee, O'Brien;<br>
  Brown and Somers, Davys, Brenon,<br>
  Custance, Trevor, Ricketts, Blanchard;<br>
  Foltringham, Bellayse and Bidmead;<br>
  Jones and Kirby, Evans, Foljambe&mdash;<br>
  <i>Meat for a Turkish Hound?</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The place is thick with dust now; men's lungs are choked
and oppressed by it....  They stamp&mdash;nothing can stop
them stamping in time to the blows of the stool-leg on the
window-sill of the room where lies the shapeless body of the
comrade whom the <i>asâyisi</i> have beaten into pulp.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  "What for the deil that killed Ted Ullathorne&mdash;"<br>
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The wild song breaks off here, as the madman ducks below
the level of the window-sill&mdash;and a cry of rage goes up from
a hundred throats as he rises again, with the disfigured body
in his arms, its head lolling helplessly beneath his own....
Then&mdash;a German Army revolver cracks&mdash;and with blood pouring
over the face that is still laughing dreadfully, Govan, with
his awful burden, reels back into the room....
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0403"></a></p>

<h3>
III
</h3>

<p>
The voice of a German officer breaks in, giving a sharp
order in Prussian-flavoured Turkish.  There is a rush of
<i>zabtiehs</i> and <i>postas</i> to the door of the building where the
madman is....  As they jostle in the filthy entry, the boots of
those who have got in first, thunder on its crazy stairs; and
savage shouts and the tumult of a desperate struggle break
out in the sordid room where Govan&mdash;bleeding from a bullet-wound
in the head&mdash;but equal to a dozen men in the strength
of his insanity&mdash;stands over the disfigured corpse laid out
upon a dirty sack.
</p>

<p>
In the mud courtyard below, as Hamid Bey, with the German
officers; his following and escort of police are retreating
discreetly backwards to the vantage of the courtyard gate&mdash;a
prisoner with a savage curse, dashes a handful of muddy
orange-peel full in the livid face of Hamid.  The Bey, smothered
with filth and choking with rage, jerks his revolver from
its holster, and promptly scatters the offender's brains.
</p>

<p>
Were the Bey unaccompanied, a volley from the Winchesters
of his escort would silence for all time the rioters about him.
But the German commander has previously informed him
that on the morrow the War prisoners under his jurisdiction
at Shechem will be deported for purposes of exchange....
</p>

<p>
Wild shouts, and British cheers break out....  Old War-slogans
are heard again....  There is a furious rush of naked
feet, but the Military Police and the <i>postas</i> of the guard beat
back the unarmed mutineers with rifle-butts, and drive them
back on either side, clubbing and kicking them.  But less
because of this the tumult is quelled than because a tall, ragged
man with long tawny hair and beard has rushed from the
archway of one of the Barrack buildings; and bringing, in this
desperate hour, the authority of the priest to reinforce the
influence of the friend and helper, exhorts, implores,
commands the maddened prisoners to submit to the brutal
authority they have no power to resist.
</p>

<p>
They are not cowed, but they obey.  The clenched hands
drop whatever missiles they have chanced to seize on,&mdash;their
owners, in a storm of kicks, curses and blows with the
rifle-butt, are herded back into the Barracks by their guards.
</p>

<p>
Barney, the jester, for once at a loss for a gag, huddles
on a sack half-filled with straw on one of the wooden
platforms,&mdash;six feet wide and two above the floor&mdash;a couple of
which, running parallel, longitudinally divide each room.
Divided into sections by upright planks, each section of platform
accommodates or discommodes six War Prisoners.  Perhaps
Barney's room, and others on the upper floors are a thought
less vile in flavour than these on the lower storeys.  He smokes
his last remaining fag, then whistles a dreary ragtime,
staring through the barred window in front of him at the
unbarred window of a room that is over the courtyard gate....
</p>

<p>
It is the window of the Commandant's office: the bare,
seldom-used room where, on Sundays, as a signal favour,&mdash;the
priest has been allowed to celebrate Mass and hold a
Bible-class, and on rare occasions an impromptu smoking-concert
has been given.  It is full of Turkish <i>postas</i> in khaki, and the
braided blue of the Osmanli gendarmerie.  It is at first not
possible to get a glimpse of what is going on inside, but in
obedience to some order the window is cleared of the bodies
blocking it....  Now it can be made out that the officers are
Hamid Bey and the German general, seated with the secretary
and <i>aide</i> at a table, before which&mdash;with two troopers of
Mounted Police behind him, stands a tall, pale, emaciated
man with long red-gold hair and beard.
</p>

<p>
The man seems to be answering a series of interrogations.
He asserts, he denies emphatically, he pleads, but he does not
cringe.  Driven to silent frenzy by the difficulty of seeing, and
the doubtfulness of the trend of the events that are taking
place in the room over the gateway, Barney looks at his
neighbour, the Sergeant of the R.F.C.
</p>

<p>
"Sergeant!"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"
</p>

<p>
The Flight Sergeant's broad hands are sheltering his eyes
as he lies on his stomach on the platform.  The little folding
binoculars that magnify by 20 are solving for their owner the
problem of the Commandant's Room.
</p>

<p>
"D'yer pipe wot's goin' on?  In the office over the gytew'y?
Where 'Amid, blarst 'im! an' the two German orficers is
settin' at the table and the Father standin' up in front? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  They're playin' a scene out o' the Old Testament!"
says the Flight Sergeant, with a sarcastic twitch of a muscle
in his thin cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Wod'jer call it? ..."  Barney breathes hard....
</p>

<p>
"The Scapegoat!"
</p>

<p>
"The 'ow much? ..."
</p>

<p>
"The Scapegoat.  The beast the ancient Jews burdened with
the sins of the congregation&mdash;and drove into the Wilderness
every year.  Only&mdash;the Padre's the Scapegoat&mdash;in this case."
</p>

<p>
"'Oo? ... Not Father Forbis?"
</p>

<p>
"Father Forbis right enough!  'Left&mdash;turn.  Quick&mdash;march.
Party&mdash;shon!'" mimics the Sergeant, as the high fair head
and stern aquiline profile of the priest, with a <i>zabtieh's</i> fezzed
head before, and another behind him,&mdash;passes across the field
of vision limited by the frame of the window, and by the
opening of a door an angle of light is thrown on the
whitewashed office wall.  "Now the <i>sira-châwush</i> is ordering out
the Prison Guard escort....  It's all over....  They're
taking him away! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Dismissed after interrygation....  That's all....  Cheero!
In a minnit 'e'll come back through the yard-gyte an' go to 'is
quarters as gay as a bloomin' bird...."
</p>

<p>
Barney defends his opinion with desperate optimism.  But
his heart is sinking leadenly and a lump is in his throat.
</p>

<p>
"All serene!  Have it your own way.  You'll see which is
right of us!"  The Sergeant cautiously raises himself up.
"Do you hear the escort's looted British boots trampin' down
the stairs?  Now they'll either turn in here or march out at
the Main Entrance.  And if they do that, there'll be no Mass
for the Catholics on Sunday morning&mdash;and no Prayers for
the rest of us when Mass is through.  And no one to get us
the allowance from the Consul.  And a dog's death for the
sick, ay! and a dog's burial.  There! ... Do you
hear? ... That's the outside gate shutting..."
</p>

<p>
"Yus.  O my Gawd!  Shall we ever see 'im agyne?"
</p>

<p>
The inner gate of the Barrack courtyard has not opened.
The sentries posted right and left of it maintain their position
unmoved.  But the groaning of rusty bolts in stone grooves,
and the sound of the ponderous outer gate of the Main
Entrance opening and slamming, falls, heavy as a clod of
churchyard clay, on the hearts of many men.
</p>

<p>
For their priest, their helper, their counsellor and friend
has gone from his place among them, and the blank he leaves
is beyond mere words to express.  And even worse than the
sense of loss is the cruel uncertainty.  Wondering, conjecturing,
they lie on their verminous benches as the long hot
Palestine day creeps to the sunset hour.  The prayer-call from the
mosques heralds no supper.  Prisoners who resent massacre
and villainous usage must, in the opinion of the Bey, have
been too lavishly fed.  The soldiers of the guard divide the
beans in oil; and Barney Mossam, tightening his belt, is more
than ever certain that Virtue, outside the walls of the
T.R. Drury Lane&mdash;is not a game that pays....
</p>

<p>
The breeze freshens, the great bats come out to steal fruit,
and the lesser ones to hunt moths and mosquitoes.  Night
suddenly unfolds her wings&mdash;and down comes the Dark.  The
jackals howl on the confines of the town, and the pariah dogs
bay hideously.  The Turkish equivalent for Lights Out! is
sounded by the prison <i>boruzan</i>.  Silver clear, the trumpets and
bugles of the German-Turkish garrison challenge the echoes
of Ebal and Gerizim.  The radiant Hosts of Heaven come
forth, and the moon, in her last quarter, hangs over the Hills
of Gilead.
</p>

<p>
Sleep has come to the prisoners.  The mud walls shake with
their snoring.  Only a few are wakeful.  The Flight Sergeant
is one of these.  Towards the middle of the night a 'plane goes
over Shechem:
</p>

<p>
"A raiding or reconnoitring hydro from some carrier in
the Mediterranean?  No!  There's no rattling from the floats.
It is a land machine...."
</p>

<p>
The airman leaves the crowded bench, and steals to the
window.  In the white effulgence of the moon all objects stand
out clear.  The German look-out with the telescope on the
minaret of the Great Mosque of el Kebir....  The hooded
searchlight with its dozing and waking guardians, on the
balcony lower down....  A little figure moving on the ragged
shoulder of Ebal....  A child? ... No! a woman&mdash;scrambling
up from limestone terrace to terrace....  He forgets
her, for, with the deep, vibrating song that he remembers&mdash;into
the field of his vision swims The Two-Faced Nightingale....
</p>

<p>
At about a thousand feet up, she circles smoothly above
Shechem.  The search-ray from the balcony of the Great
Mosque slashes at her viciously.  Its fellow from the flank
of Gerizim, leaps out, but sinks down again.  Her pilot fires
an orange light&mdash;and the scimitars of radiance from the
Mosque and the Mount return to their scabbards; no strings of
green rockets explore for the range of her&mdash;and no shells from
the anti-aircraft guns in the Square of the Khan scream up
at her winged shape....
</p>

<p>
As the biplane hovers against the jewel-bright blue of the
Eastern night, the little Zeiss glasses tell their owner that her
pilot has a native observer.  A big Arab in a striped mantle,
and headcloth bound by a rope....  Now her pilot fires a
second orange light, drops his weighted despatch-bag, banks
and climbs, launching at a dizzy height into a descent of
sweeping spirals....  Evidently he is going to land
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Shechem....
</p>

<p>
There is silence as the engine is cut out....  The big 'plane
dives out of sight behind the shoulder of Ebal, where the
lowest tiers of greyish-yellow limestone terraces are merged
in the sandy, rolling plain....
</p>

<p>
The Flight Sergeant holds his breath and waits, his eyes
glued to the binoculars.  In a wonderfully short space of time
the aëroplane, a powerful tractor biplane of D.H.6 type,
climbs into his field of vision,&mdash;rises in wide, masterly spirals,
banks, turns and flies away Westwards,&mdash;leaving the Flight
Sergeant wondering with his chin upon the window-sill....
</p>

<p>
For the Two-Faced Nightingale has shed her observer, the
big man in the striped Arab <i>abâyi</i> and roped <i>kuffiyeh</i>.  Puzzled,
the Flight Sergeant creeps noiselessly back to his place
on the wooden platform, and lies awake, chewing the cud of
mystery, for the rest of the long miserable night.
</p>

<h3>
IV
</h3>

<p>
Dawn brings surprise to him, and the other War prisoners
of the Barracks.  After the distribution of the morning
half-brick of gritty black bread, they are given a second ration,
and told to get ready, as they are all going away.
</p>

<p>
To this end they are presently mustered in the courtyard,
carrying their various packs and bundles.  Sick and well,
unwashed, haggard, unshorn; on naked feet, or feet that are
bandaged with the remnants of puttees.  Some in tattered
khaki tunics, others in cast-off German or Turkish jackets;
many bareheaded, others covered with German military caps
or broken sun-helmets,&mdash;as sorry a collection of scarecrows as
Turco-German neglect and brutality can make of two hundred
and twenty brave men....  A Turkish bimbashi of infantry,
attended by a châwush, gravely pretends to inspect the French
and British prisoners.  In the name of his Empire he bids
them farewell.  Some try to raise a feeble cheer when both
sets of big wooden gates are thrown open,&mdash;and they see a
string of some half-dozen German motor-lorries waiting in the
sunny road.  Sick and well, they are marched forth under
guard and packed into these vehicles,&mdash;those unable to stand
being carried out by <i>postas</i>.  Then, followed by some weeping
wives, the Arabs, Jews and Armenians, chained neck to neck
in double file,&mdash;are led away&mdash;a disconsolate procession, bound
for no man knows where....
</p>

<p>
Even as they leave the foul place of their captivity, the
Barracks is filled from wall to wall by an entering battalion of
Turkish Reservist Rifles, part of a Brigade hastily summoned
by Von Kressenstein from the Caucasus, to be launched on
the journey to Mespot, and now brought down here.  Swarthy,
hairy men, armed with the old long Martini, some covered
with the fez, others with the drill <i>enverieh</i>, some shod with
sandals and leggings, others with German Army boots.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the Railway-line from Shechem not being available&mdash;it
was extensively damaged a little while back by British
bombing aircraft&mdash;and on the repair of it many of these War
prisoners have bitterly toiled!&mdash;they are bumped over villainously
bad roads to railhead at Nakr&mdash;en route for the fierce
red city of Aleppo, where as they are now aware and Heaven
knows how they have got the knowledge!&mdash;the sick and
disabled are to be picked out for Exchange to England, <i>via</i>
Smyrna&mdash;and the able-bodied (such as they are!) sent north
to Belemkh, a station in the Taurus Mountains, headquarters
for gangs of War prisoners working on the rails....
</p>

<p>
The villainous road that buckjumps through the tumbled
Palestine landscape is crowded with Turkish Field, Horse, and
Mountain Artillery, conjured back from Mesopotamia by Von
Kressenstein, and rushing forward to the defence of Junction
Station South.  Battery after battery rolls by in the blinding
dust; guns and waggons pulled, and riders carried by tough
Anatolian horses, bitterly ill-used and evidently poorly fed.
But not the roll of iron-shod wheels and the clatter of
iron-shod hoofs, nor the roar of human voices talking in many
Oriental dialects, nor the curses and jeers and viler things
that are hurled at the prisoners in the jolting lorries, can shut
out the savage, irregular thudding of Turkish Krupp 75 mms.,
Turkish Mountain Artillery, and machine-guns; and the
steady, dogged slogging of British Royal Garrison Artillery
motor-howitzers; British Field Artillery eighteen-pounders;
and the clat-clat-clatter of Lewis machine-guns, waging bitter
battle in the west and south....
</p>

<p>
At Nakr, where there is to be a delay of several hours,
owing to the detrainment of forces from Mespot, they find
a composite train of second and third-class compartments full
of Turkish War Prisoner guards and their commanders, and
horse-trucks, packed with British officers, waiting under steam
for a German Staff Deputy Director of War Prisoners,&mdash;and
a Controller of Transport,&mdash;who are going to Aleppo and
thence to Smyrna to arrange the conditions of their exchange.
The British officers are the recent captives of the stone-prison
and the wired enclosure at Shechem.  Very sunburnt are
they:&mdash;very haggard, weary, thirsty, shabby and ill-shaven, and
burdened with tattered valises and heterogeneous odds and
ends of personal property, but bright of eye, elastic of
bearing&mdash;full of the indomitable spirit that from the days of
Agincourt and long before them&mdash;has been the birthright of their
warlike race.
</p>

<p>
Crowding like schoolboys at the half-doors of the padlocked
and guarded horse-trucks, they shout cheery greetings, salutations
and scraps of information to the rank-and-file, clustered
like swarming bees on the grilling stretch of platform beside
the iron track....
</p>

<p>
"Hear the guns, W. and S.?  Putting the wind up Djemal,
aren't we?"
</p>

<p>
"Halloa!  Mossam of B&mdash;&mdash; Company, my late Platoon!
I've not seen you since I launched you with a note to the
O.C. the water-camels at Rashid....  Have you got hold of a
new song, or are you still denying relationship with Potsdam?"
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you Jollife, you chap with the Turkish fez and your
eye in a sling?  My Orderly in front of Gaza!  What price
that leg of roast goat with the skin and hair on?  I'll bet
you'd tuck into it quick enough now&mdash;if you got the chance!"
</p>

<p>
A graver, older officer leans out and calls to the soldiers:
</p>

<p>
"Can any of you men give us news of Father Forbis?
We've been on the look-out for him since we heard we were to
be moved."
</p>

<p>
"The Padre! ... Where's the Padre? ... What are you
shaking your heads about?  Damn you, you hairy brute!
Why do you savage the man? ... What the hell has he done
to you? ..."
</p>

<p>
Thus the ringing British voice, sharp and acrid with
indignation.  For Barney Mossam, screwing himself up to answer,
has been clubbed by a <i>posta's</i> rifle-butt full in the mouth.  He
spits out blood and broken teeth, and grins pitiably; and for
his sake and his comrades', the officers address them no more.
Now the Turkish Station-Master and the German R.T.O. who
is his master, appear on the platform, as the Deputy Director
of War Prisoners and the Controller of Imperial Transport
and their escorts arrive on the scene in German Army motor-cars.
They board the dirty first-class compartment specially
reserved for them.  Their orderlies and servants stow away
their luggage, the signal falls&mdash;and the train&mdash;with a
non-commissioned officer on the platform of the corridor-car
conveying the German officials&mdash;armed with binoculars and sharply
on the look-out for British bomb-carrying aircraft, jolts over
the warped, unevenly-laid metals for El Fuda Junction and
Deraa, the first stages of its journey North....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
An Arab horseman, stationary beside the track with two
mounted companions, controlling his fiery dapple-grey mare
with a master-hand upon her jingling bridle&mdash;resplendent with
the gold and silver jewellery lavished on horse-furniture by
the wealthier Bedwân, gravely salutes with his long lance
tufted with sable ostrich feathers, as the composite train jolts
out of Nakr.  And the Deputy Director of War Prisoners
and the Controller of Imperial Transport, sitting opposite
one another in their dusty first-class compartment, with tall
tumblers of Munich beer, (iced, in this land of dust and
drouth) on a table fitted between them ... smoking the fat
cigars of Hamburg and discussing German Military Supremacy
and German World-politics&mdash;gravely finger the brims of their
sun-helmets in recognition of the salute....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wer ist es!</i>  Who now, is that Arab? ..." asks the Controller,
whose bulging, light-grey eyes are sharp-sighted behind
their tinted glasses.  "A personage of some consequence, by
the gold embroidery on his <i>burnus</i> judging; the gold twist in
his head-rope, the gold-hilted sword in his waist-cloth&mdash;and
the also-with-precious-metal-enriched trappings of his
Blauschimmel mare."
</p>

<p>
"He," the Deputy Director replies, "is one of the lesser
Emirs of the Irregular Cavalry of the King of the Hedjaz,
who&mdash;as the Herr General Controller knows,&mdash;secretly under
British leadership&mdash;upon the City of Mecca seized in June
and annexed Akaba in July."
</p>

<p>
"And is now wrecking trains on the Hedjaz Rail, containing
German Ottoman forces, under the very noses of our Allied
patrols,&mdash;blowing Turkish Railway-bridges with charges of
nitro-glycerine sky-high&mdash;and in the North and East our
rearguards harassing.  <i>Donnerwetter!</i>  Why is this rogue of an
Arab not in fetters?  What makes he, hanging about trains
containing military officials of the Fatherland?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, Herr General, the Emir Fadl Anga and his
followers are of those who the solid worth and philanthropic
aims of Germany recognise, and scorn the windy emptiness
and rapacious greed of England, the Great Swashbuckler....
They what we Germans have done for the Turkish Army also
see&mdash;and are convinced that under similar auspices, Arabia,
hand in hand with Egypt and India, might become a powerful
and war-capable State.  Emir Fadl Anga estimates the
number of his party&mdash;headed by a nephew of the Mecca Sherif&mdash;as
very considerable.  'They are many,' he in his Oriental
hyperbole, says, 'as the stars of Heaven, or the Desert
sands!'  Also, information has by him been supplied, which, had the
difference between German and Arabic clock-time at our
Shechem Headquarters been better understood&mdash;might have
resulted in a <i>Handstreich</i> very gratifying to Imperial Majesty
at Berlin.  The officer guilty of this so gross ignorance was
brought to a drumhead Court Martial and degraded, the Herr
General will be pleased to hear!  However, the Emir's intentions
were agreed to be excellent, and he has now brought us a
basket of carrier-pigeons from his Chief, the nephew of the
Sherif&mdash;and the Emir is to convey back with him of these
birds a similar basket, trained at the Nazareth Headquarters
of the Herr General-in-Chief, Liman von Sanders&mdash;as soon
as the pigeon-master-Sergeant with them arrives....  Also,
this is good beer!  What does the Herr General say to another
bottle?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ja, ja</i>.  <i>Mit Vergnügen</i>.  It is hellishly hot! ..."
</p>

<p>
The Emir Fadl Anga, ingenious purveyor of genuine but
post-dated intelligence&mdash;salutes gravely, and wheels his
dapple-grey about as the composite train bumps out of Nakr.  A
muscle in his lean, dark cheek jerks, and his thin lips under
the Arab beard smile scornfully&mdash;as his glance falls on the
rank-and-file of the War Prisoners&mdash;clustered on the platform
beside the iron way....
</p>

<p>
They are hot, faint and weary under the bite of the sun,
amidst this jumble of naked hills, on whose chalk and
limestone knees they have driven elaborate systems of trenches
for the enemy, under the lash of the loaded hide-whips.  But
Barney Mossam, with a split top-lip and a scarlet gap where
several front teeth are missing, is making a gallant effort to
buck the others.  In the middle of a spirited rendering of "I
HAVEN'T seen the Kaiser for a VERY long time.  He's the
leader of a German Band, an' he AIN'T no cousin of mine!"&mdash;breaks
in the fierce interruption of an Arab voice, bitterly
abusive:
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;O you!  Sons of <i>farrâshes</i> prostitute concubines!&mdash;silence
that brother of howling apes!"
</p>

<p>
Thrusting his lance-butt in the embroidered leathern
bucket, Fadl Anga leans low from his saddle&mdash;appears to
pick up something, no doubt a pebble&mdash;rises erect, and hurls
the missile savagely into the brown of the crowd of men.  It
hits Barney, who picks it up, and white teeth flash in the black
beards of the other mounted Arabs, and a laugh goes up from
the Turkish guards, who are smoking and chatting and eating
water-melons, as the supposed emissary of the traitorous
nephew of the Sherif of Mecca touches his mare with the
sharp edge of the broad copper stirrup&mdash;and with a ringing
shout of <i>"Allah ho Akbar!</i>" gallops down the rocky road
towards Shechem, followed by his two companions, and
leaving Barney Mossam gaping&mdash;with an embroidered Arab
purse&mdash;heavy with Turkish silver coins, clutched in his hand....
</p>

<p>
Long before the composite train went jolting out of Nakr
the keen grey eyes under the <i>kuffiyeh</i> of Fadl Anga&mdash;eyes less
miserable now that by day and night sharp danger gives a
spice to life, so empty void of Katharine&mdash;have assured their
owner, Edward Yaill,&mdash;that Julian Forbis is not with the
officers in the cattle-trucks any more than he is with the men
clustered like swarming bees upon the grilling platform,
beside the iron track.

<p>
The weather changes before dawn.  Soggy clouds roll inland
from the sea, hide the sky of Eastern azure, blot out the
shining faces of the stars and invest the pale beauty of the
Queen Planet of Night with the flowing sable veil of a recent
War Widow.  It has come on to rain&mdash;a slashing downpour
of Palestinian intensity, under which the wadis speedily
become shallow cataracts of khaki water&mdash;the trenches slashed
in the terraced Judæan Hills, and manned by Turks, Germans,
or British Crusaders&mdash;mere troughs of sandy or chalky
mud.
</p>

<p>
Sangars ramparted with boulders may offer some practical
assurance against shell-splinters or bullets, but against rain like
this they offer no security.  Bivouacs built of stones, and roofed
with ground-sheets may in some degree keep out the rain, but
they freely admit the cold.  A Scotch mist, clammy, freezing
and blinding in its damp opaqueness blankets the Hills of
Ephraim, and broods over the Maritime Plain, as on the edge
of one of the limestone terraces that fringe the robe of
Mount Ebal,&mdash;a big, brawny Arab sits&mdash;nursing a badly-ricked
ankle, and swearing in the fruitiest vernacular of his adopted
land.
</p>

<p>
It is lucky for the Arab in the brown camel-hair shirt,
striped <i>abâyi</i> and roped white linen head-cloth, that he has
no audience but the scorpions and lizards sheltering from the
slashing downpour under the grey-white boulders&mdash;as he rocks
himself and nurses his ricked ankle&mdash;and curses his luck.
Presently, as the Scotch mist lifts, and the plain is irradiated
by the watery moonlight, he sets his teeth for an effort and
crawls to where a bundle tied in native cloth, and a long,
metal-tipped Arab walking-staff lie on the chalky, puddled plain
where they fell when he dropped them from the machine at
the beginning of the volplane, and screwed himself as the plain
rushed up, to wait the throttling down of the engine&mdash;the long,
smooth final glide&mdash;the flattening out following the pilot's
raising of the lever&mdash;and the slight jarring impact of the
thick-tyred wheels with the ground....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Now</i> jump!" the sharp, strident voice of the Egyptian
called when the expected shock seemed imminent, and John
Hazel set his teeth and jumped promptly.  Aware even before
he crashed to ground that the word had been given too soon.
Even as he sprawled on the chalky plain, with all the wind
knocked out of his body&mdash;the machine just missed landing on
top of him.  How he rolled out of the way of the thick
squat wheels, and the steel framework of the under-carriage
of the biplane, a powerful and heavy machine of D.H.6 type&mdash;he
does not know now....
</p>

<p>
Sick, faint and shaken, he picked himself up, but not before
Essenian, lithe as an acrobat, freed himself from the
safety-belt, jumped out, adjusted the controls, and swung the
big propeller.  As the engine started he leaped back to his
seat, looked round at Hazel, shouted "Good-bye!" and opening
the throttle, raced over the plain, and rushed up into the
air as though pursued by a fusillade of machine-gun
bullets.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Damn and blast the Egyptian beast!" John snarls, and,
as the ricked joint rapidly swells to cricket-ball size, swears
again, and thinks as he rubs it, "Might have guessed he was
out for some treachery or other.  Though how could I?&mdash;until
he signalled to the enemy over Shechem by firing the Verey
light, and gave away the whole show by dropping a message-bag!
Making me swear before the start by all we Hazels hold
most holy, never by word or sign to let out anything I might see
him do.  Consequently I'm his confederate&mdash;tarred with the
same brush.  And now I know he murdered Captain Usborn!
It was his own revolver-bullet I showed him at the Club.
If ever I get out of here I stand some chance of getting shot
myself for being back at the Front on the quiet when I'm
supposed to be on leave in Alex.  But anyhow I hope I'll see
Essenian Pasha get his dose of British lead before I do.
Unless I get a chance to settle him myself.  Wouldn't I let
the beggar have it!  Right in the neck&mdash;where Winnie wore
the beads.  But what a flier!  Holy Smoke! what an A1. flier!
Unless he's a devil, which I trend to believe!&mdash;there's not
a man his match."
</p>

<p>
The rain that began at two a.m. by his wrist-watch (hidden
under a broad band of untanned sheep-leather, laced on John's
big wrist by a slender thong) shows no sign of abating.
Fitfully and at intervals through the night, those guns in the west
and south have held debate.  Now they begin again with
redoubled energy.  John has seen as the D.H.6 travelled through
the clear azure Palestine night, how the enemy's line has
been thrust back from Gaza towards Jaffa.  Now with a great
blowing-up of Turco German ammunition-dumps, Junction
Station,&mdash;key of the northern railway system&mdash;announces to
the echoing hills the success of British arms.
</p>

<p>
"Good for us!" John chuckles, rather drearily&mdash;as the sullen
sky in the south is illuminated by Aurora Borealis-like effects
of orange, green and crimson&mdash;and Brock-like sheaves of flame
spurt from the horizon to descend in gold and silver showers.
"Djemal Pasha's Fourth Army Corps seems to be getting it
rather badly.  We're putting the breeze up Von Kressenstein,
unless I much mistake...."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Even as John Hazel hugs the thought, the train containing
Djemal Pasha's German Corps Commander is rushing towards
Jerusalem.  The Turco-German Army, broken in two, is
retiring eastwards upon the Holy City and north-west through
Ramleh towards Tul Keram.  The brigades that rolled into
Shechem overnight&mdash;rested and fed, are rolling out again.
Fresh batteries from the Caucasus, diverted from Mesopotamia,
new battalions of infantry of the Redif and Mustafiz,
and brigades of irregular Cavalry from Kurdistan and Northern
Albania, are swarming down to reinforce the Nizam and
its Ikhtiât.
</p>

<p>
Dawn comes with cessation of the freezing, pelting rain
and the sun glows fiery red through the curtain of leaden-coloured
mists that yet hang over the Mediterranean.  Wounded
and stragglers on foot, German Army motor-lorries laden
with escaping Teuton officers, begin to arrive at the Holy
City.  It is whispered in Jerusalem the Weary that the days
of Ottoman rule in Palestine are numbered, that the
German, Turkish and Austrian officials and residents are even
now preparing to quit the town.  And indeed German depots
are hurriedly emptied; sugar sold as cheap as the dirt that is
in it&mdash;long held-up flour and cereals disposed of in haste.
From the high towers of the City and from the Mount of
Olives one can see the roads that are muddy now&mdash;and will
be dusty presently, crowded with lorries, carts and
pack-animals carrying fugitives with their baggage, munitions and
essential stores, north to Shechem or east to Jericho....
</p>

<p>
John, unaware of this, yet senses great happenings, as he
stands propped on his Arab staff, cursing the temporary
uselessness of a man with a sprained ankle-joint.  He must lie up
somewhere until the anguish abates and the cricket-ball reduces.
A hut&mdash;there are clusters of drab-white specks, indicating a
village on the northern fringes of the stretch of plain&mdash;boulder-strewn,
bush-dotted, thinly grassed, thick with tufts of mandrake
and tall blue Campanulas, and knee-deep in growth of
late-blooming, white and yellow asphodel&mdash;on which Essenian
elected to come down....  Westwards towards the sea there
are other, larger villages.  South there is a broad defile,
curving east between humpy limestone hills, leading, John knows, to
the town of Shechem.  Over him rises the huge and bulky
Shape of Ebal, three thousand six hundred and ninety feet
above sea-level.  From terrace to terrace, a path winds up to
her towering rounded crest between hedges of tamarisk, broad-leaved
grey-green cactus, and prickly pear plentifully laden with
knobby red fruit.  On her summit the map has shown John
the ruins of an ancient fortress.  Near the top, on this, the
west side&mdash;stands a little whitewashed cupola surmounting
a wall of mud and stone encircling a Moslem well.
</p>

<p>
Water is there; and hidden away with his revolver and
cartridges on John's big person, is a case of First Aid
necessaries, a small flask of brandy and some meat-lozenges in case
of need like this.  He determines to crawl up to the place of
the well, hide, and doctor himself for a day, or even two days
until the sprain is reduced, and he can get about.
</p>

<p>
"Hard luck," he mutters to himself, "but there's no good in
grousing....  Now buck up and help me&mdash;O all you Big
Old Men!"
</p>

<p>
But the Big Old Men give no sign, and their descendant,
shouldering his bundle (to bear out his role of Arab there ought
to be a donkey or a woman to carry it), limps, leaning on his
staff and sweating with pain, up the narrow pathway leading
between the hedges of cactus and prickly pear.
</p>

<p>
Blood-red, the Sun rises over the distant horizon, the glittering
drops upon the leaves, the drying puddles under John's
naked, slippered feet are reddened by the reflection.  From the
broad, prickly leaves the wet begins to steam; the tufts of
snapdragon, pink and crimson, white and yellow and orange; and
the blue campanulas, growing in the tissues of the rock, stand
gallantly upright, refreshed by the dampness; the lily-like
asphodel exhales its delicate, characteristic smell.
</p>

<p>
There are goats on the Mount, John notices, presently.
Their droppings are thick upon the path he climbs.  He hears
them bleating, and sees them, feeding under the ruins of the
Fortress.  Indeed, the next wind of the path brings him out
upon a ledge where a heavy-uddered female is cropping the
thyme that grows there, with a jet-black kid nuzzling at her
side.  If one could catch the mother, thinks John, the question
of subsisting here for days would be easily settled.  Prickly
pears are eatable....  Goat's milk is good....  There were
lots of milch-goats in the caves of Sheria, and modern
Crusaders, dry with the drouth of battle, and as yet uncertain
whether the enemy had not poisoned the wells&mdash;milked the
goats into their tin hats and other receptacles, and drank and
were mightily refreshed.  If only&mdash;even as John licks his lips,
the too-nimble dairy, skipping from ledge to ledge, recedes
from view.  Bleating, the little black kid scrambles after
her&mdash;and the Moslem well near the summit of Ebal seems farther
off than it did before.
</p>

<p>
John sees now a path, branching off to his right hand, which
may lead to the hut or cave of the goatherd.  He strikes out
upon it, and makes some progress, until the curve of it,
trending southwards, suddenly shows him a narrow road, deeply
rutted with broad-tyred wheels, and pitted with hoof-prints,
leading up the Mount from its base on the south-eastern side.
The erect brown figure of a sentry&mdash;reduced by distance to
the size of a doll&mdash;stands out against the background.  A
Turkish Artillery waggon is jolting up the steep roadway....
John hears the panting of the toiling horses, the creak of the
straining rope traces, the jingle of chains and the cracking of
the drivers' thick-lashed whips....
</p>

<p>
From behind a bush he now looks down into a sangar built
of boulders, sheltered at one end with green tarpaulin and full
of Turkish machine-guns.  The tarpaulin quivers with the
snores of sleeping gunners, whose legs project beyond it, and
from a nest of camouflage lower down the mountain, the
blunt nose of a howitzer snuffs at the sky.
</p>

<p>
Still farther south a Field battery of Krupps has been posted
on the flank of Ebal; the whinnying of horses eager for their
morning barley and forage comes from a hollow where the
Turks have stabled their teams, the smell of some aromatic
burning wood spices the air with sweetness.  Blue smoke
columns up from fires of hidden bivouacs.  There are picquets
along the foothills, and on the plain are outposts.  The
Mount&mdash;except on the west and north whence danger is not
apprehended&mdash;has been converted into a veritable wasps' nest.
</p>

<p>
Holding his breath, John Hazel turns, and noiselessly
retraces his footsteps between the cactus hedges and along the
path to where it first branched off.  As he sets his lame foot
gingerly upon it, he encounters a veiled native woman, toiling
upwards, who carries&mdash;not an excessive burden in this land
of laden women&mdash;a bundle of canes, and an empty gourd, and
has a coarse jar of red earthenware balanced on her head.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the earthen Jar contains water, or milk, or <i>laban</i>,
that mixture of excessively sour milk with finely-chopped mint,
peculiar to Syria.  The bare idea intensifies John's thirst.
</p>

<p>
"O my mother!" he begins in quite passable Arabic: "In
the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ai&mdash;e!</i>"  The woman has started and dropped the gourd,
and stands before him trembling, "What&mdash;what wouldst thou?"
</p>

<p>
"Somewhat to wet my throat.  Thou lookest on a thirsty
man.  Hast thou, by any lucky chance, drink in the vessel?"
</p>

<p>
"The vessel is empty.  See you, I have spoken truth!"  She
takes the jar from her veiled head and turns it upside
down, and John's heart sinks to the bottom of his famished
stomach.  "May God relieve your need! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Allah favour thee!  Black is my fortune.  Thou seest,"
he thrusts out the swollen foot with the bulge at the side
of the ankle-joint, "what evil has befallen me through a slip
upon the Mountain side."
</p>

<p>
"It hurts thee? ..."  He cannot see the hidden face, but
in the faint voice there is a note of pity....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wallah</i>!  It hurts like very hell!  Worse than the hurt is
the lameness.  Now hear!  By the life of my head I say: If
thou, being a woman, couldst help it somewhat! ... If thou
knewest a place of shelter where I could lie and tend the
hurt, and&mdash;and&mdash;have somewhat to eat and drink while it
was mending, for this I would pay thee.  By Allah!  I am no
beggar, I!"
</p>

<p>
The Fellaha thinks, while a little dusky hand holds the
edges of her veil together.  Then she says faintly:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ala râsi</i>.  I have&mdash;I know of a place of shelter.  It is not
very far from here.  There thou couldst lie, it is a cave between
two boulders and I would bring thee food and drink."
</p>

<p>
"Allah requite thee, O my sister! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Come, then, Sidi!"  She returns her empty vessel to its
place upon her head, with the deft, accustomed swing of the
Eastern woman, and moves on before him, striking into
another lateral path, a mere goat-track to the unpractised eye,
that scores the mountain-side, running north.  For perhaps a
quarter of a mile her little bending figure hurries along and
the tall Arab, leaning on his staff, hobbles painfully after.
Where the cave between two boulders is&mdash;and less a cave than
a hollow under a projecting ledge of nummulite limestone&mdash;he
finds her waiting him....
</p>

<p>
"In here, Sidi!"
</p>

<p>
"Call me not Sidi!  I am no person of degree."  John
thinks it well to try on the woman the story he has invented.
"No person of degree am I.  Only Ali Zaybak the Bedawi, a
man who once had three camels, and ten sheep, and five goats,
and a father and two brothers, and a wife also; and now
has none; my brothers, my wife and two camels being killed
and all the rest lost...."
</p>

<p>
"May the Dispenser of Mercies atone to thee, O Ali Zaybak!"
says the thin faded voice from under the woman's veil.
"How came about thy loss?  From whom dost thou claim the
blood-wreaks?"
</p>

<p>
"From the Inglizi, (English) the thrice-accursed ones!  who
came flying over our village&mdash;we dwelling in the Shadow of
Allah in the caves of the Wadi Sheria&mdash;I and my brothers
having bought exemption from service with the Army of the
Osmanli (Turks) with the savings of all our lives."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," the thin voice assents, bitterly.  "Few and small
were the gold and silver coins remaining on thy wife's
head-tire, when the Dispensers of Exemption had signed thy card."
</p>

<p>
"Verily, Allah be my witness! and it is a black shame to
take the money that was the woman's marriage-gift.  We
were then very poor&mdash;but we had the three camels and the
sheep and the goats also&mdash;though the beasts were little and
thin.  Then came the War, rolling all about us&mdash;with marchings
and counter-marchings of hosts of men&mdash;and we sent my
brothers south so that they might sell to the Inglizi soldiers
before Gaza, all the olives stored in old oil-tins, and all the
oranges, and tobacco, and grape-treacle, and figs of last year,
that the Almani and Osmanli had not taken away...."  John
cannot for the life of him restrain this vitriolic touch.  "And
they went, and made much money&mdash;the Inglizi being fools and
wealthy, moreover&mdash;as all these sons of Sheitan are.  This was
in the month Shbât; and coming home my two brothers
encountered Fate, in the person of a Commander of the Almani
(Germans), who seized upon the young men&mdash;they being far
from their native village and not having their <i>warakas</i> of
Exemption on them&mdash;and sent them to dig trenches at the Bir-es
Saba Works."
</p>

<p>
"A bitter tyranny the Most High beheld, and will avenge
upon the doer!"
</p>

<p>
"Then there was fighting at the Wady Sheria&mdash;because having
taken the strong place of Bir-es Saba, ay! and the ridges
down to the sea, the British desired the Place of Good
Wells."  John is beginning to believe in Ali Zaybak, the Bedawi
farmer, to the point of getting hot over that individual's
fictitious woes....  "Came they&mdash;they came, and were as hornets
about us, their <i>killis</i> bursting with stench, and smoke, and
ruin&mdash;and their Devil-Birds fighting the Devil-Birds of the
Almani, and driving them down out of the air.  One dropped
an egg of Eblis that killed two of our camels, and broke the
leg of the third.  My father cried out on Allah and fell face
downwards....  So my wife cried out and fell, and when
I went to lift them, lo!&mdash;they were dead....  Yet was there
no wound on either....  <i>Wallah</i>!  Upon neither was there
a wound! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Well do I believe thee.  I have seen Death come after that
fashion many times since the beginning of this War.  What
more, O Ali Zaybak? ..."
</p>

<p>
"This,&mdash;that my goats and sheep being gone from me&mdash;for
the <i>Osmanli</i> took them when they retired before the Inglizi&mdash;I
have come to Shechem to seek my brothers, if haply they
be alive and there! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but why seek them on the Mount of Cursing, and not
within the town? ..."
</p>

<p>
Woman-like, she has put her little wasted, dusky finger
on the weak spot in John's trumped-up story.  Having done
it, she goes on, as he racks his brain for a
sufficiently-convincing figment:
</p>

<p>
"Thou wilt do this to-morrow, O Ali Zaybak the Bedawi,
when the swelling of thy joint hath abated and thou art rested
and fed.  So creep in here between the stones&mdash;there is a
sheepskin thou canst lie on&mdash;and in somewhat less than an
hour I will come back to thee with food and drink."
</p>

<p>
"May Allah prolong thy years, O woman!" says John with
the extravagant hyperbole and the sing-song inflection proper
to Oriental gratitude.  "May thy fortune be doubled upon thee,
and, fair as thou art already, may the radiance of thy beauty
out-dazzle the full moon!"
</p>

<p>
She gives a queer little rustling laugh behind the folds of
her coarse, yellowish head-cloth.
</p>

<p>
"Sweet words, sweet words from a widower bereaved in
Shbât!  Belike," she cackles again, "thou hast come to the
Mount of Cursing in search of another bride?  Dost thou lust
for the Unrevealed?  See, then, O Ali Zaybak! what beauty
hides behind this screen! ..."
</p>

<p>
And accompanying the words with a swift revealing movement,
she whisks back the heavy veil from that mutilated left
side....
</p>

<p>
"My God!" John very nearly exclaims, bleaching under his
natural mahogany-colour, for a man old in War and hardened
to the sight of wounded men may yet sicken at the sight of a
woman mutilated like this.  But he swallows the exclamation,
and substitutes:
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;am sorry!  May Allah pity thee, poor soul! ..."
</p>

<p>
"And increase the wisdom of the Sidi! ..."
</p>

<p>
The Fellaha is re-veiled and between the pendent linen folds
comes her little rustling whisper; chilling the blood of the
pretended Ali Zaybak, under the now nearly vertical rays of
the blazing Syrian sun....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Who, desiring Secret Intelligence for his War-Chiefs of
the British Army, ventures into the midst of the enemy,
disguised as an Arab and alone! ...</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The words drop, coldly as lumps of hail, on the adventurous
heart of the man.  Discovered, and in the first hour by a Syrian
peasant woman....  He forgets his pain, and drawn to his full
height, fixes his black eyes threateningly upon her hidden face.
</p>

<p>
"What sayest thou?  Hast thou no fear?"
</p>

<p>
"None&mdash;of a British officer, nor of a British soldier!"
</p>

<p>
The words, spoken in English with a Syrian-French accent,
are such an unexpected shock, that John jolts temporarily back
into his own adopted tongue:
</p>

<p>
"How the hell&mdash;ahem!  How did you know&mdash;I'm&mdash;what you
say I am?"
</p>

<p>
"Because" the voice is soft and refined, though it is thin
and toneless: "Because&mdash;sir!&mdash;when I showed you my face&mdash;you
did not&mdash;spit like a Mohammedan, or laugh like a German!
And who"&mdash;the voice suggests the shadow of a mocking
smile&mdash;"who but an Englishman would venture here&mdash;so
ill-disguised and speaking such bad Arabic, and carry himself so
confidently as almost to deceive me&mdash;in spite of the testimony
of my two good ears&mdash;and my one very good eye."
</p>

<p>
The poor face she has shown to John is blind on that shattered
left side.  He knows a thrill of pity even as he asks:
</p>

<p>
"You won't give me away? ..."
</p>

<p>
"If 'give away' means to betray&mdash;no, I will not betray you!"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  You're out Scouting on your own," says John,
"unless I'm very much mistaken?" He adds still in English,
as she lets this broad hint pass....  "Since we're to be pals
of sorts, do you mind telling me your name? ..."
</p>

<p>
She gives her faint little whispering laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, surely.  It is Ummshni....  'Mother Ugly' in your
English tongue.  In Arabic, 'Mother of Ugliness.' ...!"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;but I can't call you that! ..."
</p>

<p>
"You must.  It is my name here.  For you I have no other."
</p>

<p>
"Then shake hands, little Ummshni," John says promptly,
and thrusts out his own huge, brown right hand.
</p>

<p>
"Need we?"  She hesitates....
</p>

<p>
He says, encouragingly:
</p>

<p>
"Just once.  To seal the bargain and show we're pals!"
</p>

<p>
"Once then...."
</p>

<p>
She hesitates an instant more.  Now from enveloping folds,
a small, shrunken, dusky hand steals out, and is engulfed in
John's.  And then a breathless cry, not loud, nor shrill, but
terrible in its dire, agonised intensity bursts from the mouth of
the distorted face that is mercifully hidden by the veil....
</p>

<p>
"God of my fathers!  Who art thou?"  The gasped-out
words are once more Arabic.  "From whence didst thou get
the Ring of the House of Hazaël? ... Thy face, too....
It is the face of Eli!  Thy voice....  Do not deny
it! ... Thou art of the Blood! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Since you know it already I'll tip you the garden truth.
I'm John Benn Hazel, old Eli's grandson from London.  But
who in the name of&mdash;wonder&mdash;are you? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Thy&mdash;thy unhappy Cousin Esther!"  The words come
stumblingly, between terrible, dry sobs....  "Oh, do not check
me.  Let me weep!  I have not for so long! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Now by&mdash;the whole blooming, blessed row of Big Old
Men, back to the Very Biggest!" John says between his teeth,
as leaning on his heavy staff he stands staring blankly down
at a little heaving bundle of coarse and common feminine
drapery that crouches at his big sandalled feet amidst
the short thyme-scented grass, "This is&mdash;this is the cherry in
the cocktail!  Just when I'd begun to think I wouldn't carry
through&mdash;comes along the very sort of little woman to help
me!  This isn't Coincidence or anything like it.  This
is&mdash;just&mdash;Fate! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Help thee?"  Her sobs have abated, she lifts up her bowed,
head.  "In what manner can I help thee?  I can feed thee,
tend thy hurt and hide thee.  But there is something more
than these....  Tell me what thou wouldst do? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Save a man!"  No one is near, but he whispers it, stooping
over the little figure.  "A War Prisoner they've got here.
Get him out&mdash;and get him away! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes!  Willingly will I help thee.  Hath an Hazaël
ever failed to answer to the Call of the Blood?"  The little
dusky hand clutches at his brawny wrist.  She rises, and
her eager breath mingles with his, and an eye diamond-bright,
black as his own, flashes between her veils....  "What strength
I have&mdash;what cunning and courage&mdash;are thine, to the threshold
of Death and beyond it.  But&mdash;but, John, my cousin!  If I
help thee to free thy man&mdash;thou must needs deliver mine."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sweet on conditions&mdash;they're things that handicap.
Who's your man?"  The tone is decidedly gruff.
</p>

<p>
"He is an English officer....  There is no other in
Shechem since the big German petrol lorries rolled out this
morning.  For the Turks have sent them all away ...  I heard, to
Aleppo."
</p>

<p>
"The hell you say!  Forgive me, little Esther, but this is&mdash;pretty
rough!  For I'm here&mdash;bad Arabic and all&mdash;on the
track of a British War Prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me his name," says the thin rustling voice, shaken still
with emotion....
</p>

<p>
"Julian Forbis....  Father Julian Forbis," John answers,
and she falters:
</p>

<p>
"O my cousin! in thine hour of need and mine the Most
High, Blessed be He! hath verily sent thee.  For&mdash;for&mdash;thy
man and my man&mdash;are one!  Come now to the secret place
where I dwell alone with my sorrow.  There we can talk
freely&mdash;it is safer than here.  Thy hand on my shoulder&mdash;what
a big hand, like that of our grandfather Eli! ... Lean
on thy staff, but on me too.  I am stronger than thou wouldst
dream...."

VI
</h3>

<p>
The line held yesterday by the Turco-German forces has
bent northwards at its western extremity, and southwards at
its eastern end.  Jaffa, the ancient Port of Jerusalem, has been
occupied by Allenby's forces.  Junction Station, the key of the
north, now being in British hands, the enemy's Army, cut in
two, has retired partly east into the mountains towards
Jerusalem, and partly northwards along the Coastal Plain.  The
nearest line upon which its several portions can re-unite is the
line Tul-Keram, Shechem.  Reports from the Royal Flying
Corps indicate the intention of Djemal Pasha and the other
Corps Commanders to evacuate Jerusalem and withdraw to
organise on the line Tul-Keram, Shechem.
</p>

<p>
It being vital to obtain a hold of this invaluable artery of
thoroughfare, which traverses the Judæan range from north
to south from Shechem to Jerusalem,&mdash;our Advance has
wheeled to the right, and struck into the Hills with the object
of wresting from the enemy the Jerusalem-Shechem Road.
</p>

<p>
At the eastern end of the long fish-shaped valley, whose sides
are shagged with olive-woods and running with springs, and in
which lies Shechem, is a grassy, level expanse in the shape of
an isosceles triangle&mdash;one of its longer sides being the road
that runs east and west past the new Turkish Barracks, the
Arsenal and the Hospital&mdash;and the other the road that&mdash;north
of this&mdash;passing the Mohammedan Cemetery and the ancient
Tombs that are upon the fringe of the limestone robe of Ebal,
runs into an ancient Roman road, that completing the shape
of the isosceles, goes north along the eastern flank of Mount
Ebal to the little hamlet of Sichar, and south to the Holy
City,&mdash;leaving on the left a Mohammedan well that has been built
over the Tomb of Joseph, and some quarter of a mile farther
on, a hillock shaded by mulberries and figs, and covered with
ruins, enclosing <i>Bir Samariyeh</i>, or the Samaritan Woman's
Well.
</p>

<p>
The top of the triangular patch of waste ground ends at
the very gate of Shechem, being lost in the great mounds of
immemorial ashes, brought down in ancient days from the
Temple on Mount Gerizim.  Wild fig and mulberry, olive and
tamarisk&mdash;and thickets of the <i>zizyphus</i> set with formidable
thorns, that give the tree its name of Spina Christi&mdash;make a
shabby jungle of the Ash Heaps, haunted by kites, crows and
owls, pariah-dogs and jackals, who come to feast where the
offal and refuse of the town are thrown.  Here, too, lepers
congregate; sick animals are thrust to die, dead ones are
thrown to bleach and putrefy; and sometimes&mdash;even before the
War&mdash;bodies of people robbed and murdered, or too destitute
of friends to be given burial&mdash;huddle amongst the rank weeds
and tangled undergrowth, or lie stark and dreadful, with blind
eyes beaten by the lashing rains of Palestine, or staring at
its pitiless sun.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Allied War Prisoners first came to the town of Shechem,
the isosceles triangle of waste ground&mdash;its shortest side
indicated by the road that runs by the Tomb of Joseph towards
the Well of the Samaritaness&mdash;was enclosed within a twelve-foot
double fence of German barbed-wire, for the keeping of
certain French and British officers, who declined to give parole.
These lived in Turkish Army tents and messed in a ramshackle
wooden hut near the eastern end of the enclosure; their rations,
such as they were, being brought from the Turkish Barracks
twice a day.  Those officers who gave parole, causing less
trouble to the authorities&mdash;were somewhat better treated, it may
be allowed.  The old stone prison near the Suk was alloted as
their quarters.  They were permitted to take exercise within
certain bounds, even to visit the Latin Fathers, and the
headquarters of the Protestant Mission, and better their diet by
making purchases in the town bazar.  To-day, Shechem, with
her numerous mosques and her flat-brown roofs embowered in
orange and pomegranate-trees&mdash;is bursting full of Turkish
troops, and their German military masters; and destined ere
long to rival Tul Keram as an Army H.Q.  No British War
Prisoners are left in her since the exodus of early morning,
save four Berkshire and Devon Yeomen lying desperately
sick at the Turkish Hospital&mdash;two London Territorials, and
three Indian troopers in the charitable care of the Sœurs de la
Sainte Croix....
</p>

<p>
Ah, and the solitary captive of the leaky wooden shanty in
the Wired Enclosure, from which the Turkish Army tents have
been removed, leaving round yellow patches of parched and
trampled grass.  Saving the Bey, certain of his German friends,
several Mounted Police, and a guard of infantry from the mud
Barracks&mdash;no other persons in Shechem suspect that Father
Julian Forbis did not leave yesterday for Aleppo with the other
British officers,&mdash;though possibly that dust-like one, the Mother
of Ugliness, may have a certain inkling of the truth.
</p>

<p>
Upon a native <i>anghareb</i>, a short-legged, palm-wood bed-frame
with coarse sacking laced upon it, he lies within the hut
that used to be the Mess.  Although it leaks in the winter rains,
its timbers are of solid oak, and its door is heavy, and secured
on the outside by a huge wooden lock.  A padlocked iron fetter
on the priest's ankle is linked to a chain finishing in a ring,
running on an iron bar,&mdash;the ends of which, being bent, have
been driven into the corner-posts at the end of the hut that
is farthest from the door.  Having thus secured the prisoner,
the <i>bash-châwush</i> of Mounted Police went away with his troopers
and the escort.  That was yesterday morning, possibly in
the neighbourhood of nine o'clock.  The common watch of
gun-metal on the priest's wrist has stopped&mdash;as the result of
brutal usage....  He can only calculate Time by the
prayer-call from the mosques of the town....
</p>

<p>
No hint of the possible length of his confinement has been
given, the <i>bash-châwush</i> being an old hand and quite thoroughly
understanding the torture of Uncertainty.  No food was
brought the prisoner yesterday or to-day; they have not even
given him water....  Nothing has passed the man's lips&mdash;since
on that morning of the Bey's visit he broke fast with the
thin boiled wheat-porridge and the black bread on which War
Prisoners are fed.
</p>

<p>
Mere hunger he can endure....  As a Religious of a strict
Order he is well inured to fasting.  But the thirst, aggravated
by mental distress, sleeplessness and anxiety, is torture.  His
lips are cracked, and his throat and tongue so dried and leathery,
that the effort to speak above a whisper would be positive
pain.
</p>

<p>
The two narrow apertures that serve as windows are some
eight feet above the floor-level.  It is not possible to see out of
them.  Through chinks and knot-holes in the walls of stout
though ancient timbers&mdash;it might be possible to get a glimpse
through the twelve-foot fence of barbed-wire&mdash;out upon the
road running east from the gates of the city, and the road
running north and east by the Wadi Farab to the Jordan Valley,
and southwards from Shechem to Jerusalem....  But the
man chained to the iron bar lies in a feverish stupor on the
sacking of the <i>anghareb</i>.  There are strange noises in his ears
like the clamour of voices in many tongues&mdash;like the clatter of
innumerable hoofs, the rattle of wooden wheels and the vibrating
grind and din of heavy motor-traffic; but he is too faint
and weary to be curious as to their cause.
</p>

<p>
We know, that even as reinforcements of Turkish troops of
the Redif and Mustaphiz are being rushed from the Caucasus
to form reserves upon the fissured Plain of Ephraim&mdash;has
begun the exodus of such inhabitants of Jerusalem as are not
strict Mohammedans&mdash;or known to be Turco-German in views
and sympathies....  Since the noon prayer-call, vehicles of
every type, loaded with fugitives of the better class, have been
rolling into Shechem, the roads leading to the town are
blocked&mdash;a haze of dust envelops everything since the sun dried up
the torrents of rain that fell at break of day....
</p>

<p>
Came yesterday, Von Geierstein, the once famous War
Minister&mdash;now Field Marshal and Commander-in-Chief on
Germany's Battle Front in Asia&mdash;post haste from his Great
Headquarters at the red city of Aleppo.  To meet Enver Pasha,
Djemal, and the other Turkish Commanders at Jerusalem,
harangue the defeated generals, and reorganise the
Turco-German War Plan on more successful lines....
</p>

<p>
Fallen into eclipse at the Court of Berlin as the result of
his military failures at Verdun, horribly disconcerted by the
disaster of the Vulkan Pass, inexpressibly sickened by the
taking of Beersheba, the fall of Gaza and the loss of Junction
Station,&mdash;the brilliant ex-favourite of Imperial Majesty (whose
ambition has had more to do with the kindling of the brand
of War than that of any other man in Germany&mdash;saving Von
Tirpitz)&mdash;after warning Enver and Djemal of the uselessness
of endeavouring to hold Jerusalem now the Gaza Line has
been broken&mdash;left the Holy City this morning for Shechem, in
his Œstler-Daimler, another with his Staff Officers, following,
half his escort of armoured Scheff cars preceding him&mdash;the
remainder, with his servants, bringing up the rear.
</p>

<p>
Even as the Governor, Izzet Bey, and Ali Fuad Pasha,
Commander of Turkish Forces in the Holy City&mdash;issue the
proclamations of their masters to the people, our troops are
pushing up the passes into the Judæan Highlands; the sound
of British guns comes even from the Vale of Sorek,
thenceforward the din of battle grows louder hour by hour....
</p>

<p>
Already in Shechem, in Samaria and in Jericho&mdash;whither the
Latin, Greek, Armenian and Coptic Patriarchs have been forcibly
deported, with other ecclesiastics and notables, and wealthy
Zionist Hebrews&mdash;the reign of terror that has prevailed in
Jerusalem since Turkey joined issues with Germany&mdash;has
begun.  Ten Turkish pounds are asked, and got, by Mohammedan
drivers for a seat in a carriage.  Large numbers of the
wealthier inhabitants, with the remaining chiefs of religious
communities, have been warned by the Turkish Police to be in
readiness for exile.  No more vehicles being available for
the transport of the victims, Djemal Pasha&mdash;venomous always,
seasons the order with the intimation that the deported
population will be compelled to travel on foot....
</p>

<p>
Spies swarm everywhere.  Fear presses like a heavy hand
upon the public mouth.  Arrests, confiscations and requisitions
redouble&mdash;populations quail under the lash of tyranny.
Gallows are set up at the Jaffa Gate&mdash;there are hangings and
shootings daily.  The bodies of the victims of the last battue
are left exposed for hours, to impress upon the population that,
after four centuries of oppression, the Tartar is not disposed
to surrender one of the Holy Cities of the Turkish Caliphate
without a final orgie of extortion, brow-beating and blood.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The day wears on, no succour comes, and the priest's stupor
of exhaustion deepens.  Towards sunset there is a heavy knock
upon the door of the hut.
</p>

<p>
"Come in!"
</p>

<p>
The captive's first effort to speak aloud results in a croaking
whisper.  The heavy Turkish lock scroops in its wooden
mortice, and something like a smile twitches the lips of Julian
Forbis.  Is it not the very brutality of irony to knock upon
a starving prisoner's door?
</p>

<p>
Now the door swings inwards, letting in a wedge of noon-tide
brightness, but the visitors delay a moment on the threshold.
And a strange voice says, as though in answer to a
question, speaking in cultured Arabic, softly and melodiously:
</p>

<p>
"No!  Nothing may be done in the Holy City; the influences
there are too adverse.  But at Banias!&mdash;and here on Mount
Gerizim&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Even as the utterance strikes with a strange, premonitory
shock and thrill upon the consciousness of the prisoner, the
door is pushed open to admit three men.
</p>

<p>
Two German Staff officers, tall, burly and swaggering, and
a slight man, dark-hued as smoke, bearded, and of forbiddingly
handsome countenance, arrayed in a dazzlingly white brocaded
silk <i>kaftan</i>, girt with a gold embroidered crimson cincture, and
a flowing <i>kuffiyeh</i> or head-drapery of the same fierce
sanguinary colour, bound with a thick twist of silver and gold
cords.
</p>

<p>
Two German officers of inferior rank, with a lieutenant and
sergeant-major of Turkish Mounted Police and several troopers,
are seen beyond the threshold.  Now the heavy door shuts
the four men in together....  The priest lowers his feet to
the stamped earth floor and rises to receive the visitors.  But
so weak is he that he totters, and sways as though about to
fall.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
His giddiness passing with the dimness of his sight, he
discerns that one of his visitors is the tall, sunburned,
trap-mouthed German general who visited the Barracks yesterday
in company of the Bey, and whose order put the period
of a shot from a gendarme's repeating Winchester, to Govan's
crazy song.
</p>

<p>
His companion is a handsome person, as yet in the early
fifties, superbly built and of heroic size and stature.  The
grey-green Field Service dress suits him to admiration; not
a button or buckle is out of its true alignment; his gloves,
belts, revolver-holsters and boots are of immaculate earthy-brown.
His spurs are of steel and gold; his single-breasted
Norfolk-shaped Service jacket shows, as does the other man's,
the narrow silver lace, the crimson collar-edging and shoulder-cords
of the Great General Staff&mdash;the Iron Cross dangling at
the buttonholes of both by its ribbon of black and white.  Both
wear the ribbons and brochettes of many decorations.  But
the taller man displays, in addition to these, the Order of the
Prussian Black Eagle with diamond swords, hanging by a
swivel under his collar-hook.  And noting this distinction,
together with the wearer's physical beauty&mdash;for he is yellow-haired,
blue-eyed, straight-featured, handsome still, as the Viking
hero of some old Teutonic Saga&mdash;it flashes on the priest
as his own blue eyes, set in hollow caves of exhaustion and
hunger, encounter the visitor's&mdash;that the man can be no other
than the fallen favourite of the Emperor of Germany, now
Commander-in-Chief of his army in Palestine....
</p>

<p>
Nor is the priest's conjecture wrong.  It is the man, weary
and disgruntled, sick with conscious failure, savage at the
fancied triumph of old rivals and ancient enemies&mdash;wounded
in the one vulnerable spot of his hard, vain, shallow heart
by the death of his son, a brave young Flying Officer&mdash;killed
in a duel with a British airman in January, 1915.
</p>

<p>
He spent last night at the old Army Headquarters, the
Kaiserin Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives.
Ah, with what heartiness has Von Geierstein cursed the Turks
as he turned his back upon the Holy City; as his fleet of cars
ate distance upon the road to Shechem&mdash;where he is to dine,
and sleep, if he can.  He is keenly alive to their military
blunders.  For there are good Teutonic brains behind the brilliant
eyes that light the handsome face to which he owes his rescue
from bankruptcy&mdash;and his subsequent promotion from the rank
of Chief of the General Staff of the 4th Army Corps, Magdeburg,
to the dignity of Prussian War Minister&mdash;and the more
dubious position of alter ego to William of Hohenzollern.
</p>

<p>
Over, over, the meteoric and splendid career.  Fallen, beaten,
ruined.  Rich in the world's goods still, but bankrupt in the
world's envying admiration.  Left by the tide of Success on
which he has floated so buoyantly,&mdash;he sees himself once more
high and dry on the mudbank of Failure&mdash;not by the utmost
expenditure of cleverness to be floated off again.  His
magnificent blue eyes are dark with wrath.  He grinds his teeth,
eminently white, and all his own&mdash;as he devotes the Ottoman
Allies of Imperial Germany to the uttermost depths of Hell.
</p>

<p>
Unlucky favourite! never again to draw all eyes in the White
Hall of the Imperial Palace at Berlin, while morning sunshine,
streaming through the tall windows, shines upon the opening
Session of the Reichstag&mdash;makes glittering play with the silver
livery of Prussian State flunkeys, and strikes multi-coloured
sparks of fire from the decorations and military orders of the
members of the Federal Council, ranged on the left of the
Throne.  Never again to stand, the dazzling centre of a blazing
constellation of Generals, by the daïs under the black, red and
white Canopy&mdash;topped with the blazon of that Bird of ill-odour,
whose greedy claws and rapacious beak, and insatiate maw
are not yet glutted&mdash;though twenty millions of men and women
have perished to slake its quenchless thirst for human blood.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The Herr General Von Krafft, that you speak good German
has informed me, Reverend Father? ..."
</p>

<p>
His own English is guttural, but passably decent.  The priest,
master of several dead, and some half dozen modern tongues,
replies as well as his parched throat and palate will allow.  His
German, the distinguished visitor concedes, is very good for
an Englishman....
</p>

<p>
"Though you belong to a Scotch family, I am given to
understand by the Herr General....  I am deeply grieved
that your much-desired reunion with your relatives has been
farther delayed by your own unfortunate lack of tact.  I refer
to your regrettably-insolent treatment of the Bey, Our
Ottoman Ally, who should command respect."
</p>

<p>
He is sick to nausea of Germany's Ottoman Ally even as
he says it.  His handsome lips twist with hatred of all things
of the Turk Turkish, under his glittering up-brushed moustache.
He is revolted by the fetid, stifling hut, by the pallid
prisoner chained to the dirty native bed, but most by the sense
of Failure dominating everything....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Over, over, over!</i>" says the voice that is always in his
ears, sounding above the roar of moving Divisions and the
crashing of artillery from the workshops of Krupp and Skoda,
keeping time with the throbbing of the blood in his temples
and the irregular beating of his wearied heart.  "<i>Beaten,
beaten, beaten! ... Fallen, fallen! ... Total Kaput! ...</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Not "Your Excellency" or other flattering title.  Under his
lowered lids, set thickly with dark lashes,&mdash;they accused him
of using cosmetics, in his younger, more effeminate days,&mdash;he
looks at the wasted, high-bred face, and meets its pure
glance.  His dead son, killed at twenty-two in the air battle
with the English aviator, had eyes like this man's.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, an accusation similar to this was brought against me
yesterday in the presence of," the blue eyes go dauntlessly to
the other German's face, "General Von Krafft.  I said then,
as I reiterate now&mdash;that the charge is without foundation!
As a man of honour and a Catholic priest, I deny it absolutely.
I can bring creditable witnesses to refute it whenever there
is need."
</p>

<p>
"Kindly name your witnesses.  Where are they to be found,
sir?"
</p>

<p>
They have all left for Aleppo, the priest remembers with a
shock.  He says, with a sinking heart:
</p>

<p>
"The guards of the Barracks would give evidence in my
favour."
</p>

<p>
"It is they who accuse you! and I myself heard
you-with-words-encourage, and saw you by gestures stimulate the
mutineers to fresh acts of violence!"
</p>

<p>
The harsh voice of the Bey's friend, the tall brick-faced
General, says this with a rasp of something like ill-will.  The
priest draws himself proudly up and meets the glance of the
false accuser.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I can only say that you&mdash;are mistaken."
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner, though you be a priest, you shelter yourself
behind a lie!"
</p>

<p>
The white face flushes scarlet, and the blue eyes blaze
indignantly.  He draws from his tattered tunic-breast a small wooden
Crucifix, touches the Feet of the Victim with his pale lips,
and lifts the Crucifix high.  As he does this the dark bearded
man in the white silk <i>kaftan</i> and crimson kuffiyeh glides
hurriedly towards the door.
</p>

<p>
"So help me God, I have spoken the truth!"
</p>

<p>
Very quietly the words have been uttered.  Thrusting the
sacred symbol back within his breast, he confronts his
enemies, awaiting what may come.  The momentary silence past,
the highest in military rank addresses the priest
grandiloquently:
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner, as the Military Representative in the East of His
Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Germany, I assure you that
investigation will be made into this affair.  But as the
testimony against you is absolutely unshakable," the tall and
splendid personage who speaks gracefully salutes the brick-faced
general, "it is equally my duty to tell you that the decision
of your judges will go against your oath.  As a guest of
the Turkish Empire you will naturally be considerately
treated&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The blue eyes meet his again....  <i>Gott im Himmel!</i> how
like the dead boy's....  The white lips smile ironically....
The weak voice rings strong:
</p>

<p>
"Your words sound like sarcasm, sir, to the guest of the
Turkish Empire, who has been confined without food or even
water since early yesterday...."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0407"></a></p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
The stuffy interior of the prison hut swims about the priest
as he speaks.  He sees a look of something like irritable
compassion cross the handsome face on which his eyes are fixed.
Its owner regrets the oversight, and will give orders that it
shall not be repeated.  Even as the prisoner voices thanks,
he has a fleeting glimpse of an ugly, mocking grin on the flat
brown features of the brick-faced German General.  He hears
a little, hateful, malicious laugh from the dark, bearded,
white-robed personage who stands in the background....  He sees
him approach the brick-faced man, and whisper in his ear.
</p>

<p>
And his ordinary senses, wrought to preternatural acuteness
by suspense, hunger and sleeplessness, and that sixth sense
which belongs to some anointed Servants of Heaven, warn
Julian Forbis&mdash;have warned him since the mysterious shock
and thrill that accompanied the stranger's entrance&mdash;of
something more than sinister&mdash;more than terrible or dangerous, in
connection with this white-robed, bearded man.  He feels,
emanating from his personality, an aura of sheer
Evil&mdash;poisonous to the soul's health, paralysing to the will....
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His voice dies away.  He is dizzy with weakness.  Lights
flash before his eyes, the hut spins round, and the two tall
German officers and the man in the red head-drapery seem
to join in the giddy whirl.  Now he staggers, and sinks down
fainting, his head and shoulders resting against the framework
of the bed:
</p>

<p>
"It is damnable!" impatiently says the wearer of the Order
of the Black Eagle, pulling out a gold pocket-flask, and
finding it to be empty.  "The man is dying&mdash;useless!  See if
there be not water somewhere.  Tell somebody to bring some
here! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Immediately, Excellency."
</p>

<p>
The flat-faced general is going to the hut door when the
wearer of the red head-drapery gracefully interposes:
</p>

<p>
"What says the Shaykh? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Excellency, that wine will be better than water!&mdash;and that
if you will observe a moment's silence, I will undertake that
some shall be brought...."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed.  Most exceedingly interesting, my very dear friend
Sadân! ..."
</p>

<p>
A meaning look is exchanged between the two German officers.
Smiling, the smoke-dark, bearded man steps into the
middle of the floor-space, faces to the East, and looks back at
his companions, saying in a sharp, clear tone:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Uskut!</i> ... By your Excellency's leave, I must strictly
enjoin respect&mdash;and silence...."
</p>

<p>
He lifts the long, wide ends of his gold-embroidered girdle,
with them covering his dark, slender, joined hands, and turns
to the East again, saying: "<i>Dastûr!</i>  By Your Permission, O
Ye Blessed Ones! ..."  Their spurred heels aligned, their
hands rigidly at the salute, the two officers standing behind him,
erect, unwinking and stiff, might be mistaken for coloured
statues&mdash;save that their broad chests heave slightly with their
noiseless breathing, and the glittering hairs of the
Commander-in-Chief's moustache bristle like the whiskers of a watchful
cat.  There is a sobbing gasp or two from the fainting man
lying propped against the <i>anghareb</i>; from the man in the red
head-drapery, whose joined, covered hands are lifted&mdash;comes
a sibilant low murmuring, but in the hut there is no other
sound....
</p>

<p>
Until with a sharp, hissing final utterance, that might be the
close of an invocation, the covered hands of the Shaykh are
lowered.  He bows his red-veiled, gold-crowned head over them,
and turns round with a flashing smile:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Kolossal!  Wunderbild!</i>" the Germans mutter, relaxing
their attitudes of stiff respect, and exchanging glances of awe
and astonishment....
</p>

<p>
For whereas the dark hands beneath the girdle-flaps were
empty, their slender fingers, now uncovered, are seen to be
enlaced about the stem of a glittering beaker of delicate,
iridescent glass or crystal, brimming with pinkish-tinted liquor
that diffuses an exquisite bouquet upon the mouldy atmosphere
of the hut.
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing, O my lords!  The Messengers are swift-winged
and duteous," he says with his glittering smile....
</p>

<p>
Both Germans hugely admire the marvellous glass vessel,
but neither is over-eager to handle and examine it.  Or, when
pressed, to taste the fragrant wine, which the Shaykh Sadân
proceeds to pour down the throat of the swooning prisoner,
lifting his head and shoulders with an ease that shows the
great strength latent in his own small-boned Asiatic frame
and delicate extremities....
</p>

<p>
The glass is nearly empty now, and between gulps of strange,
poignant, reviving sweetness, Julian Forbis is coming to the
use of his wits again....  As he sits up, then staggers to his
feet by the help of a hand&mdash;he knows not whose!&mdash;except
that it is small and strong, and that its strength is as
unexpected as its deadly, stinging coldness&mdash;the Shaykh Sadân
turns away and empties the remainder of the wine upon the
beaten floor.  A light flame flickers unperceived upon the spot
as the earth drinks the liquor....  The Shaykh, smiling,
offers the empty goblet to the German Commander-in-Chief.
</p>

<p>
"Beautiful indeed.  And of immense antiquity.  The value
of this must be great, very great! ..."
</p>

<p>
Somewhat reluctantly the Chief has taken the thing, but its
strange beauty and evident rarity tickle the <i>connoisseur</i>.  It is
thin as a soap-bubble, and as light.  It might be blown of
melted jewels&mdash;so dazzling are its minglings of ruby and topaz
and jacinth,&mdash;of sapphire and emerald and dusky amethyst.
Flawless, it rings like a bell as he taps it with his finger-nail.
Now, wearying of the inanimate toy, he looks about for a
shelf or table, but finds none; the hut being innocent of furniture
other than the bed, a battered metal bowl lying in a corner,
and a bottomless palm-wood stool....
</p>

<p>
"Permit me, O Excellent Lord!"
</p>

<p>
Seeing the Chief's evident difficulty, the Shaykh Sadân
relieves him of the fragile goblet, and with supple ease and a
graceful carelessness, sets it down upon the unsubstantial air.
Where it stands a moment&mdash;under the surprised observation of
the Commander-in-Chief and his satellite&mdash;until, with a slight
yet perceptible shrinking of its outlines, and dulling of its
jewel-bright colours&mdash;such as might have been observed in the
soap-bubble to which it has been likened&mdash;it delicately
vanishes away....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Himmelkreuzbombenelement!</i>" sputters the brick-faced
general.  His dull eyes protrude with genuine alarm, and his
morale having deserted him, he makes a hasty movement in
the direction of the door.
</p>

<p>
"See now, you have scared Von Krafft," says the Chief with
a laugh that is not quite natural.  "A hundred years ago, in
England or in Germany, they would have burned you for
that, O Shaykh Sadân!"
</p>

<p>
"It may be, O Excellent Lord!" he answers with the smile
that is so ingratiating and yet so sinister.  "But not in
Egypt&mdash;nor in Arabia, where&mdash;when the Lands of the North were
girt with ice, and inhabited by savages, the Divine Art of
Magic had for cycles of centuries been known....  Lo! the
good Shiraz wine hath worked its own witchcraft.  Speak to
the priest now&mdash;and he will hear and understand...."
</p>

<p>
"Prisoner, listen to me and prove yourself worthy of the
consideration I have shown you.  Admit frankly, that as a
Catholic ecclesiastic, you have so far forgotten your cloth, and
misconceived your duty, as to egg on the Allied War Prisoners
of Germany and Turkey to insult their conquerors....  Append
your signature to a confession of your offence, and in
return take my assurance that what mercy it is possible to show
you shall be extended forthwith...."
</p>

<p>
The priest's thin face is suffused with crimson as he listens.
He is bewildered; that wine was strangely potent in its effects.
But his candid eyes rest quietly on the Chief's angry face
and he answers without passion:
</p>

<p>
"Sir, you have already heard me declare most solemnly,
that I am guiltless of inciting the prisoners to rebel.  Against
their torture, and outrage at the hands of the Bey, I have
protested strenuously, and will continue to do so as long as I
have voice."
</p>

<p>
"You persist in accusing the Bey of crime and violence?"
</p>

<p>
"Most certainly and most truthfully I do!"
</p>

<p>
"Das ist nicht wahr!  Have I not already the testimony of
my Staff Officer?  Added to that of Hamid Bey, who is an
honourable man.  Consider, if you exhaust my intolerance, what
fate awaits you!  Admit your guilt, sign the paper, and you
shall immediately be released from this vile place, and admitted
to parole."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, as a priest I refuse to accept your offered conditions!
My body is your prisoner&mdash;my soul is not in your hands.
Beware what you do! ... I refer my case to my Bishop&mdash;to the
Latin Patriarch, and the other high Catholic dignitaries in
Jerusalem...."
</p>

<p>
"Were you in Jerusalem at this moment, my good sir!&mdash;they
would be equally impotent to assist you."  As the priest does
not know that these ecclesiastics to whom he refers have been
forcibly deported from the Holy City, the barbed point of
the jest is lost on his ignorance.  "For even if your protest
reached them&mdash;which is unlikely!&mdash;after what fashion would
these persons enforce their authority? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I do not know! ..."  The voice breaks upon a note of anguish,
and the priest's head droops for a moment on his breast.
He lifts it, and his hoarse, faint voice gathers power and
rings out bravely.  "But one thing I do know, that He Whom
I serve and trust in, will not desert His poor servant in this
extremity."
</p>

<p>
"Your faith is more admirable than your wisdom, sir.  But
I will waste no more words upon your obstinacy.  Understand,
that if when I leave you," for he has lent his ear to a
soft whisper on the part of the dark man in the red <i>kuffiyeh</i>,
"the Shaykh Sadân will, of his goodness, endeavour to bring
you to reason.  If he does not succeed&mdash;I wash my hands of
you!  The Prison Commandant Hamid Bey,&mdash;whom you have
so vilely slandered,&mdash;may deal with you as he will! ..."
</p>

<p>
A terrible shudder convulses the priest's thin frame.  As the
heavy tread of the spurred boots shakes the crazy floor, words
rush to his lips that&mdash;were they uttered&mdash;would be a cry of
surrender.  The footsteps reach the door, the door opens, but
still his teeth are clenched and his lips firmly shut.  His soul,
beaten upon by gusts of terror, striving in blackness jagged
with infernal lightnings, is like a ship in the fury of a cyclone.
Of all the great and noble things&mdash;that are jewels in the crown
of classic Literature, of all the texts of Holy Writ&mdash;of all the
liturgies of the Mother Church, with which he has stored and
enriched his memory&mdash;only six words come to him in his dire
necessity:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos, Domine!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The door opens.  Red sunset dyes the floor.  The long shadows
of the two German officers appear to stretch across a pool
of blood.  Now the door is shut, and Julian Forbis is alone
with him from whom his spirit and flesh shrink in an agony
of terror and loathing&mdash;all the more that his person is superbly
handsome, that his smooth, cultured voice is exquisitely
melodious&mdash;that from him radiates a power that allures, and
persuades and charms....  He does not mock or gibe now.  He
is all delicate sympathy.  But the priest traces the outline of
the sneer through the smile of the Shaykh Sadân, and the
mockery that grins behind the compassionate mask.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"O Darweesh of the Inglizi, listen to the words of the Shaykh
Sadân of the Beni Abba, a poor recluse of the Desert of
Igidi!  For believe me&mdash;I speak as a friend, and not as an
enemy!" murmurs the smooth caressing voice,
</p>

<p>
"Unhappy man, be not bigoted! ... This obduracy works
to your own undoing.  The great pity I&mdash;Sadân the Shaykh&mdash;feel
for you&mdash;compels me to speak thus!  Surely the garment
of a priest is cut of the cloth of <i>tasalidn</i>&mdash;the rendering of
obedience to superiors&mdash;and <i>tahammul</i>, endurance of injury....
And is not the heritage of the Prophets, Wisdom?  And
to prefer life to Death&mdash;is not that wise? ... And who gains
Wisdom but at the cost of Sacrifice&mdash;ever since in the
Spring-tide of the World, Isis&mdash;the Sister-Queen of King Osiris of
Egypt, yielded her beauty to the Angel Amnaël, one of the
Fallen Sons of Radiance,&mdash;in return for the secrets of Magic
and Chemistry....  Consider, also, that by this great Chief,
on whose breath hangs thy life, but little is required of thee?
Nothing injurious to thine honour, or inimical to British
interests in the East.  Yield, as under the death-threat!&mdash;for verily
the mercies of a furious elephant&mdash;or a hungry lion&mdash;were
preferable to those of Hamid Bey....  Bear thy share! ... Do
as thou art bidden&mdash;and solace thy soul by saying: '<i>This
would I not have borne!&mdash;that would I not have done....
But He Who ruleth all things willed&mdash;and it was so? ...</i>'"
</p>

<p>
Smiling, the speaker ceases, receiving answer:
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I have no need for sugared sophisms, nor specious
consolations....  I know too well the source from which they
come.  Set my hand to a lie will I never!&mdash;nor shield the
crimes that a tyrant has committed&mdash;to save my body at the
cost of my soul!"
</p>

<p>
"'Your soul!...'"
</p>

<p>
The last two words are re-echoed by the Shaykh with delicate
contemptuousness.
</p>

<p>
"Who barters in souls in these days, O priest?" he asks
with terrible contempt, shrugging his supple shoulders.  "For
verily in the market they are as a worthless drug! ... Come! ... Decide,
for I waste my kindness on you.  What is your
answer?  Yes, or No?  Here are paper, pen and ink."  He
draws an Arab writing-case from the folds of his girdle.
"Write now, and sign...."
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
Julian Forbis adds in a hoarse whisper&mdash;for the strength of
the strange liquor he has drunk is ebbing out of him, as his
numbing hand gropes blindly for something in his breast:
"Tempt as you may, I shall not yield!&mdash;He Whom I serve
being my helper!  'VADE RETRO SATANA!  RECEDE A ME,
MALEDICTE DIABOLI!  IN NOMINE PATRIS, ET FILII, ET
SPIRITUS SANCTI.  AMEN....'"
</p>

<p>
In faith and courage he rises above his bodily weakness.
He plucks from its concealment the hidden Symbol, and lifts
it high as he utters the terrible words.  And as they vibrate
upon the sultry atmosphere, there goes forth a terrible,
ear-splitting cry upon it, and a gust of air icy as the breath of
the Polar frost, and dry as the wind of the Sahara&mdash;moans
through the darkling place.  He is alone, the Enemy has left
him, and as Night falls, he sinks down senseless on the crazy
floor of the hut.

<h3>
VIII
</h3>

<p>
On the summit of Ebal, a little east of the ruined fortress,
is the wreckage of <i>Khirbet Kuneisch</i>&mdash;in Syrian Arabic, "The
Little Church."  Some twelve feet distant from the skeleton of
its tiny sanctuary there is a tomb hollowed in the living rock.
</p>

<p>
And in this place the Mother of Ugliness dwells alone with
her sorrow.  Secured against the intrusion of the curious or
thievish (did either discover the jealously-guarded secret) by
the belief common to Syria and the East generally, that Afrits,
ghouls, and vampires inhabit such ancient tombs.
</p>

<p>
Goats are cropping the short, sweet herbage.  They are
Ummshni's and come&mdash;like the willow-wren and chiffchaff, the
robin and the yellow-and-white European wagtail&mdash;at her low,
twittering call.  Others, feeding lower down on the wild
gum-cistus and the thyme that clothe the crumbling limestone
terraces, have recognised their mistress, and follow her footsteps,
as, with the big hand of the lame Arab leaning on her frail
shoulder, she toils up the path upon Ebal's northern side.
</p>

<p>
"See, here is my little house, O Ali Zaybak, Bedawi...."  Panting,
she shows him a broken flight of limestone steps
descending to the eastward-facing entrance of the tomb.
</p>

<p>
Supported in deep-cut grooves, on either side the low square
aperture that serves as the entrance, is the circular stone
employed of old times as the door of such a burial place; a
block of the shape and size of a millstone&mdash;having no central
hole to admit the shaft.  A knob that projects from the surface
of the stone some three or four inches below its upper rim, and
another at an equal distance above its lower rim, can be used
as the fulcrums of the human lever, that when necessary, rolls
back the stone.  From within, the tomb can be opened or
closed in the same way.
</p>

<p>
"Canst thou roll away the stone, cousin?" asks Ummshni-Esther,
"for 'tis a task that tries me sorely.  Yet must I
ever close my little house in this fashion when I leave
it,&mdash;more need than ever now since Turks came to the Mount!"
</p>

<p>
"But if they came when thou wert here, and found the
door open?" asks John Hazel, from midway down the steps.
</p>

<p>
She nods her head, and from between the folds of the Syrian
veil comes her dry, rustling chuckle.
</p>

<p>
"Knowest thou what I would but need to do to send them
down the Mountain quicker than they came up it?  Even step
boldly into the doorway, and&mdash;by the sunlight if 'twere day,&mdash;or
by the flare of a brand from my fire if it were night&mdash;unveil
and show them!  This&mdash;that makes the Turk spit, and
the German show his teeth in a grin, and the Englishman say,
'Poor devil!' or 'Poor thing!'&mdash;and all three hurry away from
the sight.  My one-eyed, crumpled face, that save thyself, O
John my cousin! and one other!&mdash;is the best friend I own.
What, dost thou hold back at the threshold until thy hostess
bids thee enter?"  For as the great stone rolls groaning into
the opposite groove, leaving a narrow irregularly-shaped
entrance, John has turned towards her, reaching up a long
mahogany-coloured arm and huge hand to help her: "Verily then,
in the name of Him Who sent thee, be thou welcome under
this roof!"
</p>

<p>
So the two, so strangely met, so far apart and yet so nearly
related&mdash;pass into Ummshni's strange, desolate home&mdash;out of
the early morning sunshine, for it is barely seven o'clock.
Three milch-goats with their kids troop after, their little split
hoofs making a soft pattering; and at a sign from his cousin,
John Hazel closes the entrance with the stone....
</p>

<p>
It is not dark within the tomb, nor is there any closeness in
the atmosphere.  This has a pleasant, dry coolness that is
soothing, like the tempered light.  Both the air and the light come
through long cracks and chinks in the roof of limestone slabs,
dressed with the hammer in bygone centuries, and intersected
by glittering streaks of crystalline carbonate; and the sloping
sides that, like the roof, Nature has thickly clothed with
bracken and bramble.  The place may be about ten feet in
height&mdash;and owns three rooms or mortuary chambers&mdash;in
whose sides are shelves, hollowed in the limestone rock&mdash;to
receive the embalmed and swaddled bodies&mdash;of which (if any
have ever rested there), the passing ages have left no trace....
The third chamber is some thirty feet in length and
reaches under the ruins of The Little Church.  Here, within a
hearth of mud and stones, a wood fire smoulders; its smoke
escaping unnoticed through a hole in the roof above it into the
nave of the ruined building overhead, that is thickly mantled
with tamarisk, and choked with cactus, prickly-pear, and the
spina-Christi thorn.  Various cooking-pots and vessels hang
from pegs driven into chinks in the walls of limestone.  Here
are a stool or so, and a small folding-table.  Here, too, a native
bed&mdash;brought up here piece by piece&mdash;stands on one side, with
some coarse woollen coverings folded on it.  Some clean, but
ragged draperies of blue cotton-print, and veils of coarse
towelling such as Ummshni wears,&mdash;hang on a cord stretched from
wall to wall, with a thick overgarment for use in winter, an
Arab <i>abâyi</i> of woven camel's hair.
</p>

<p>
And that is all.  No anchorite could own less than little
Ummshni, but the poor soul makes John welcome with what
she has.
</p>

<p>
She makes him lie down on the <i>anghareb</i>&mdash;folds the camel's
hair mantle into a pillow for his head&mdash;milks the goats, and
brings him a bowl of the thick, frothing-white, pleasant
beverage.  He empties it and says, setting down the bowl:
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, O my hostess!  May milk never be wanting in
thy house! ..."
</p>

<p>
"May God bestow upon thee long life and prosperity!"
returns the thin, shadowy voice, in the set terms of the response
to the formal expression of gratitude: "You have honoured
me! ..."
</p>

<p>
"By your life, O lady!  I have honoured myself! ..."
</p>

<p>
"By your eyes, O my guest!  I am the distinguished one!"  She
laughs her queer little dry laugh, and says, kneeling by
the hearth, and rousing the embers into a glow by puffs of
breath from between her veils, and bits of dry fuel discreetly
thrust into the reddest places: "Yet why should thou and I
talk as Mohammedans?  Are we not Jews?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I dunno! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Thou dost not know?  Not even that this is New Moon?
Wouldst thou not be in Shool this morning, if 'twere
possible?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't say for sure.  That is, about myself.  Of
course, I'm certain about you and your mother! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ah'h!"  She winces as at a sudden knife-thrust and sinks
back on her heels, trembling visibly.  "The beloved one&mdash;is&mdash;is
alive?"
</p>

<p>
"Alive and well, that is&mdash;as well as she can be! ... You
didn't know?" John asks in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"How should I know within a year? ... News filters in but
very rarely."  She masters herself, rises to her knees, and
goes on coaxing the fire, but the reddening embers hiss as
her tears keep dropping on them from underneath her veils.
"And it is best she should believe that&mdash;that I am&mdash;that I died
when Jacob! ... O, my cousin, have pity! ... Let us speak
of her no more! ..."
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Count on me! ..."
</p>

<p>
He watches as the little flitting shape glides about the dusky
chamber, and in and out of the narrow door,&mdash;bringing to
feed the fire,&mdash;more dry fuel, of which she has a heap in
the outer chamber, that serves as a store-room.  From whence,
presently conjuring ripe figs and olives; fresh eggs, green
coffee-beans, salt and rough sugar, and a little stone mortar
and pestle; some flaps of unbaked native bread and a wooden
dish of goat's-milk butter, she boils the eggs; roasts and pounds
the coffee; bakes the bread upon a metal cone placed amongst
the embers; and assembling the constituents of a decent
meal&mdash;including a jug of fragrant coffee, and another of boiling
goat's milk, upon a little battered metal tray&mdash;sets it upon the
little table at his side, and brings him a bowl of water, a bit
of soap and a coarse, clean cloth.
</p>

<p>
"Washing and&mdash;benediction, Cousin John."
</p>

<p>
He washes and mumbles something, reddening under his
head-cloth.
</p>

<p>
"Now eat and drink, mingling the coffee with milk in the
good French fashion."  She gives a small sigh.  "Would I
had better to offer thee!  But than this there is nothing else."
</p>

<p>
"The tucker's A-1.  But you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Trouble not for me.  I am a Syrian woman....  I eat my
food after the man has fed...."
</p>

<p>
Intuitively perceiving that she shelters behind this excuse
her sensitive horror of her own disfiguring mutilation, John
protests no further, but applies himself to the eggs, coffee,
bread and butter and fresh fruit, with hearty good will.
</p>

<p>
When he is satisfied she clears away; pours boiling water
into a big earthen bowl; fetches lint, bandaging and arnica
from a burial-shelf where she seems to have some store of
things like these, and tying back her long sleeves in true
Fellaha style, by knotting the ends and slipping them over her
head, addresses herself to the fomenting and bandaging of the
sprained ankle, saying:
</p>

<p>
"If thou hast tobacco with thee, smoke, O my Cousin John!"
</p>

<p>
And so he brings out a packet of maize-leaf paper, and a
bag of good Arabian tobacco, stowed away with divers other
requisites upon his large person, and rolls himself a thick
cigarette.  She gives him a light with a flaming stick from the
fire, as he is feeling for his matches; and at his:
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, little Esther!"
</p>

<p>
&mdash;bends her poor face low over the damaged ankle, to hide
the tears that will break forth anew.  For thus did old Eli
Hazaël speak to his daughter's child, and this deep voice is
very like his: and the familiar words re-open deep, unhealed
scars in her wounded and suffering heart.  Thus there is deep
silence in the tomb, broken only by their breathing; by the
flitting sound of Esther's movements within the cool, dusky
place&mdash;and by the soft munching of the three goats and their
kids in the outermost chamber&mdash;where a heap of grass and
herbage has been heaped to meet their needs.  Indeed, this
newly-found friend who has come into the desolate creature's
life, as though dropped from the skies&mdash;which in fact he has
been!&mdash;is so silent that Ummshni looks up in wonderment.
John is smoking his strong Arab cigarette with deep, regular
inhalations of enjoyment, and staring at a piece of ancient
sculpture that catches the sunshine&mdash;still that of early morning,
that falls through an aperture overhead more strongly as the
Day-Lord climbs higher in the eastern sky.  It is the bust of a
man, nearly life-sized; carved in the shallowest relief, and
bearing remains of colouring; surrounded by a half-circle of
reddish rays, from which, possibly, the gold has centuries ago
faded.  His head is noble, haggard and mild&mdash;the long tresses
of waving, reddish-yellow hair mingle with the beard, which is
slightly pointed&mdash;the splendid forehead is deeply scored with
lines, there are premature markings of care about the eyes.
These are blue, and austere under dark, widely arching
eyebrows, though the stern lips smile sorrowfully.  Under this
ray-crowned half-length&mdash;which is bounded by a line of blackish
colour&mdash;is roughly chiselled the Sacred Monogram.  Below
the letters of the Holy Name is the date of the Year 400 of
the Christian Era.  As the lengthening ray reaches this, the
soft voice asks from between Esther's veiling draperies:
</p>

<p>
"At what art thou looking, my Cousin John? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Just at&mdash;that."  He points to the stern and gentle Face
rather awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
"It is the Messiah of the Christians.  Didst thou not know?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course I'm aware of that.  Only, as you're a strict
Jewess, it struck me as somehow curious to see it here."
</p>

<p>
"It is of great ancientness.  It was here when this grey,
evil world was young and golden-haired, and perhaps even
more evil than it is now."
</p>

<p>
"Then it was pretty rotten!  But, in fact, I was thinking as
I looked at that sculpture, that the man who did it must have
seen the ah&mdash;the Original.  Though unless he happened
to have a dream or a vision, the date quite puts the lid on
that idea."
</p>

<p>
"If by chance it should be really like the Founder of
Christianity, He hath a servant who resembles Him.  For&mdash;that is
the very face of the man whom thou and I would deliver!  He
lies in the hut of the Prisoners' Field, with the high fence of
barbed-wire about its edges&mdash;that is beyond the gate of the
city, opposite the Mohammedan Tombs.  And&mdash;and," there is
a quavering break in the faded voice, "since yesterday before
the Prayer-Call they have not given him food or water&mdash;obeying
the strict orders of&mdash;one whom I dare not name!"  Quick
panting breaths heave the wasted bosom under the old
blue cotton garment, the little dusky fingers clutch nervously
at her coarse veil.  "All day I waited near the gates&mdash;thinking
by some cunning wile, some secret bribe, such as hath often
served before now&mdash;to win over the Turks on guard to give
me entrance.  But, though they licked their lips at the promise
of wine and tobacco, and sweetmeats, and love-messages to
be carried to the women of the Suk and the Bazâr&mdash;they did
not dare to let me in.  O, my cousin, I fear for the life of the
Master!&mdash;I fear! ... And all night I lurked near, hiding
whenever they changed the guard, in some covert of the Waste
Places where they throw the city refuse&mdash;and jackals and owls
and pariahs and lepers and malignant spirits dwell.  And when
the day-brow lifted I left one to keep watch&mdash;even a poor leper
woman who is faithful.  And I bought meat, and wine, and
came back here to boil soup and milk for him.  For to-night I
shall try again," her glance goes to the bundle of canes she has
leaned up in a corner, "and this time, by the help of the Most
High!&mdash;this time I shall not fail!"
</p>

<p>
"Look here, aren't you ever afraid?" John asks, in mingled
pity and admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I am always terrified!" Her veils are shaken with
her trembling and he can hear the chattering of her teeth.
"Ever since I took upon me this work of helping the miserable
and those who suffer, I have been frightened, John my cousin,&mdash;to
the very core of me....  But I go on! ...  There is no
choice!"  She wrings the little, shaking, dusky hands, and now
once more quick sobbing shakes her.  "Were there not things to
do&mdash;sick folks to serve&mdash;dangers to evade or face&mdash;what were
life worth to The Mother of Ugliness?  Think, O think! ..."
</p>

<p>
Looking at the little quivering thing crouching down beside
the now faintly glowing embers, John thinks, and comprehends,
though not quite all.
</p>

<p>
"When I recovered sense and partial sight&mdash;after the horrors
of which thou knowest!&mdash;it was to find myself in the house
of a good, poor Jew of Nazareth, whither&mdash;may the Holy One
reward his charity! he had bribed the soldiers to carry me
under cover of night.  They, who were bidden&mdash;I being as
one dead and covered with blood&mdash;to dig a pit and cast me
in with quicklime&mdash;were glad to be saved the trouble at gain
of certain moneys.  Later, by the secret sale to another man,&mdash;a
Hebrew jeweller,&mdash;of an emerald necklace I had worn on
the day when the <i>sabtiehs</i> arrested me&mdash;and which I had
stitched into my clothing in the first hours of captivity&mdash;I
know not whether it was overlooked or whether they did not
dare to seize it&mdash;because!&mdash;" she does not finish the
sentence&mdash;"I repaid the good Jew, though I found it hard to thank
him.  Hard as I find it even now...."
</p>

<p>
There is such tragedy in the low, whispering voice, such
blistering truth in its plain, naked utterances, that John Hazel
shudders as he listens to her....
</p>

<p>
"For I desired to die, when I did not remember Jacob!
When I thought of him&mdash;what I wanted more than Death
was&mdash;"  A coal-black diamond-bright eye, sends a shaft from
between the veils straight into the man's eyes.  "Thou
knowest.  Three little words will hold it all:"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Revenge on Hamid....</i>"
</p>

<p>
Her veiled head nods at each slowly-uttered word.
</p>

<p>
"Verily, ay! but I did not want to say it.  For that it was
possible to endure this ordeal of Life.  To kill him in some
slow, strange, unimagined way, I would have given"&mdash;she
laughs dryly.  "What had I left to give, my soul being dead
in me,&mdash;my body the foul thing his touch hath left it!&mdash;and
the face my mother used to kiss, a mask to scare babes and
men?  Then I said,&mdash;I will wait and hate! ... Patience and
hatred may bring me that I crave for.  Meanwhile, keeping
near him&mdash;I will succour those whom he hath wronged, feeding
my hungry hatred with their curses&mdash;until the day comes
when I shall hunger no more! ..."
</p>

<p>
"And surely the day of reckoning will come.  Only be
patient a little longer!" says the deep, stern voice that
Katharine Forbis knows.
</p>

<p>
"How like thy voice is to our grandfather's.  Almost I
could believe that Eli spoke then!  How strange, that he and
thou, so greatly resembling, should never have met," sighs
the woman beside the fire.  "Of Hebrew hast thou any?"
</p>

<p>
"None but a word or so."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, it matters not!  Go on speaking in Arabic, or
in the English that is thy home-speech&mdash;or in French if it
pleases thee&mdash;thou art Hazaël in any tongue."
</p>

<p>
"It pleases me best to listen to thee.  Tell me now, after
what fashion wouldst thou have thy vengeance? ..."  The
man's voice sinks lower, and his face is very grim.
</p>

<p>
"My cousin, let us not speak of it!" she entreats in a whisper.
He sees a wave of trembling pass over the fragile creature,
huddled in her coarse disguise beside the rude stone hearth.
</p>

<p>
"Yet when a man bitten by a mad dog, goes to a Pasteur
Institute for inoculation, he must&mdash;if it be possible&mdash;take the
head of the dog."  The fierce black eyes are upon her, and
their strength seems a palpable weight bearing upon her
frailness.  "Since the beginning of this War, surgeons have
attained wonderful skill in building up the bodies and faces
of men, that other men have broken.  When thou shalt go
to the greatest of these, saying: '<i>Give me back my beauty!</i>'
I promise thee, little Esther, thou shalt carry the head of
the dog!"
</p>

<p>
The big teeth gleam in the dark face, and she answers with
her chuckle, the thin derisive cachinnation that is so far
removed from mirth:
</p>

<p>
"And if such a miracle might be wrought, could thy great
surgeon's scalpel cut from my woman's soul the scars that
make it hideous?  Could he burn from my memory with his
electric wire, the things that I have borne?  Could he set
my feet amongst the flowers on the hills near Kir Saba, with
Jacob's and Reuben's, and Leah's, and little Benjamin's&mdash;and
brim my heart with the happiness that was Life's golden wine?
Could he give me back my father and our grandfather, the
good old man who so loved me?  How strange it is to
remember that if I had not vexed my mother&mdash;and worn the chain
of emeralds that were old Eli Hazaël's birthday gift, that day
the <i>zabtiehs</i> seized me, walking in the olive-groves near my
father's house at Haffêd&mdash;I should have had nothing of value
to sell for the wherewithal to live."
</p>

<p>
"It was Fate!  Tell me, my little Esther, how old art thou?"
</p>

<p>
She laughs in her strange way.
</p>

<p>
"On that day&mdash;the thirtieth of Ab, in the Year of the World
5674,&mdash;the 8th of August, 1914&mdash;as thou wouldst write it&mdash;I
was eighteen, my cousin John...."
</p>

<p>
Sickened to the very core, the man can barely keep back a
groan.  Twenty-one last August, and "beautiful as a rose of
Sharon," to quote Old Mendel, and aged, withered, warped,
body and soul, into the Mother of Ugliness.  Words escape
him, born of a sudden thought:
</p>

<p>
"Jacob and thy Cousin Eli are dead, like thy father, and
our uncles, and our grandfather and thy little brother
Benjamin.  But&mdash;but Reuben the son of Ephraim lives.  Has no one
told thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Verily, I knew it.  But"&mdash;her head is bowed and the words
come faint between her veils&mdash;"the young girl whom Reuben
loved lives no more.  Even though thy surgeons might work
the bodily miracle.  Even if the herb Forgetfulness sprang
from these stones, I would not gather it, and lose the memory
of certain things that have lightened my labours, and sweetened
my sufferings in this cruel place.  As for my vengeance&mdash;more
than once I have been very near it!  Wilt thou believe?&mdash;I
have opened mine hand and let the thing go!"  The little dusky
hand quivers into sight, shuts, opens and vanishes.  "So&mdash;and
so&mdash;the sharpness of desire for Hamid's blood having abated,
since&mdash;since I came&mdash;to the knowledge of him!"
</p>

<p>
The little hand waves from the covert of her veils towards
the ray-encircled head, past which the illuminating beam of
sunshine has travelled.  John, seeing this, says with
something of astonishment:
</p>

<p>
"Knowledge of&mdash;the Christ? ... And thou a Jewess?"
</p>

<p>
"I speak of the servant, not of the Master, good Cousin
John.  For that stern, beautiful face is strangely like his
whom thou didst come here to seek."
</p>

<p>
"I'll make a note of that.  It may be useful."  John Hazel's
strong black eyes glue themselves upon the Face upon the
wall, as the Mother of Ugliness goes on, whisperingly:
</p>

<p>
"This I have thought, seeing the life of the Sidi who is
His servant.  Thou art listening? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Verily, my little Esther.  For it is needful for me to hear
these things concerning the man."
</p>

<p>
So, with a full heart trembling on her timid lips, sometimes
speaking in her swift, cultured Arabic, sometimes in
her English that is tinctured with a Parisian accent&mdash;always
speaking of the priest as the Sidi, or the Master, she tells
John all she knows, up to the moment of Father Julian's
arrest.
</p>

<p>
"And what happened then?" John asks.
</p>

<p>
"They took the Master to the&mdash;the Bey's room, over the
gateway.  The&mdash;the Bey accused him of pricking on the
prisoners to rebellion.  A German officer who was there bore
testimony that the Master had so acted.  He boldly&mdash;for he is as
a lion, without fear&mdash;denied this, in the face of his enemies.
All this I heard from a Turk, a <i>posta</i> of the guard at the
Barracks.  The man loves a shameless woman of the
Bazâr&mdash;and&mdash;and I carry messages between them, no office being too
low for Ummshni, the Mother of Ugliness.  Can dirt defile
dirt?"
</p>

<p>
In her faint voice she asks the bitter question.  John says,
grinding his teeth:
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, Esther, drop that!  I can't bear it!"
</p>

<p>
"Swear not, my Cousin John, but hear.  <i>He</i>&mdash;" John knows
she is speaking of Hamid&mdash;"He says to the Master: 'You tell
me this, that and the other thing I do, gives offence to your
Christian Messiah.  I pay no heed, and, He lets me alone,
because He has no power to punish me.  For it is Allah and
Allah only who rebukes the evil and rewards the virtuous.
And to prove this, I shall put you under guard&mdash;in the barbed-wire
enclosure where we kept the British War-prisoner officers.
There is plenty of room to walk about, and a wooden hut
where you may sleep.  You will have grass, and clean air,
but nothing to eat or drink&mdash;unless you sign this paper that
I have here&mdash;saying that you repent of the slanders you have
spoken against me before my face.  Sign it now in the presence
of witnesses, and you will be sent down to join the other
War Prisoners at Smyrna.  Do not sign it&mdash;and you will be
taken to the wired enclosure, and any one found giving you
food or water, will be beaten to death with <i>asayisi</i>.  This will
give your Nazarene Prophet, Whom we Turks and the Kaiser
of the Alamani and his officers&mdash;who are all good
Mohammedans&mdash;esteem very highly!&mdash;a chance to prove how great He
is, and how He values you&mdash;by keeping you alive....'"
</p>

<p>
John licks lips that have suddenly grown dry.
</p>

<p>
"And what did Father Forbis say to this&mdash;not particularly
original devil?"
</p>

<p>
"He told Hamid he was an ordinary priest, with no
pretence to extra sanctity, and that if this was a challenge
to the Christ, he as His servant refused to take it up...."
</p>

<p>
"And then?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"'Deprived of food,' the <i>posta</i> says the Master said, 'I
perish like any other miserable mortal.  Yet if it were my
Maker's Will that I should live through such an ordeal&mdash;I
should live! ...'"
</p>

<p>
"Some priest that!"  John imagines a voice like Katharine's
saying 'I should live!' and a thrill goes through him.
"And Hamid?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hamid said: '<i>We will wait and see!</i>' and all the Germans
laughed.  It is a phrase well known in England? ..."
</p>

<p>
"And dam' well hated too!  But your Father Forbis is a
peach....  Worthy to be his sister's brother...."
</p>

<p>
"She is so beautiful and noble? ..."
</p>

<p>
"All that," says loyal John, "and more! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I am glad.  For I have thought much since I have
known the Sidi, and learned in watching, somewhat.  This
amongst other things: that to be abject, ill-used, poor and
despised, even as a lame sparrow in the sight of men&mdash;and to
go about doing good, with one hate in the nest of the heart that
chirps for vengeance, that is human, human enough!  But to
be all this, without hate or bitterness&mdash;to be wronged and pity
the wronger!&mdash;being sinned against, to pardon and love the
sinner, this is Divine! ..."
</p>

<p>
The softly-breathed words fall upon the air like scattered
rose-petals, diffusing sweetness as they fall.
</p>

<p>
"If Jesus of Nazareth were not the Son of the Most High,
O John, my cousin! after no other fashion will He come when
He comes.  Taking nothing from the world but a crust, and
a garment to cover Him.  Seeking the things that are held
despicable by men.  His Gospel Love, Forgiveness, Sacrifice.
His only diadem the Shekinah.  His path beset by thorns&mdash;  His
triumph Failure....  His end a gibbet! ... What other
could it have been?" ...
</p>

<p>
John admits....
</p>

<p>
"No other.  For if there's one thing more prejudicial to
a man than sheer Disinterestedness&mdash;I'm at a loss to name it!
The world must have a motive&mdash;and it likes a mean one best.
I don't pretend I've ever gone particularly deep into the
subject, but I've sometimes thought&mdash;that if it were possible to
see Jesus of Nazareth clearly for the Christians&mdash;we Jews
might find Him to be very much a Jew!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we shall see Him so, one day! ..."
</p>

<p>
She rises with noiseless, supple ease, and takes her bundle
of sticks from the corner.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art weary.  Deny it not, thy jaws ache with yawning,
and already I have seen thee nod....  Take off thine
upper garment and head-cloth, for it is warm here.  Lie down
and sleep, though the bed be somewhat short for legs as long
as thine.  For I have things to do&mdash;for the Master!  '<i>What
things?</i>'  Oh! the man! ever asking questions! ... Broth
to make, milk to scald, these pipe-stems," she shows her
bundle of new, clean canes, five feet long, bound by a generous
length of red India-rubber tubing, "to fit together after a plan.
The Master shall not die of hunger to-night, the Most High
being my helper.  For I shall be helped!"  She nods her small,
veiled head.  "It is borne in upon me, since I have found
thee, the Bedawi who did not spit when I let him see my face.
There is another Arab here," she gives her dry little rustling
chuckle, "an Emir with his following.  He did not spit or
curse, either, and his grey eyes said, '<i>Poor thing!</i>'"
</p>

<p>
"The hell you say! ..."  John, who has been horizontal,
sits up suddenly and blurts out in English.  "Forgive me,
little Esther, but I happen to be on the track of an Arab with
grey eyes.  Where does the bloke hang out?"
</p>

<p>
"If thou speakest of the Emir Fadl Anga, he who lodges
at the Khan et-Talab under that title&mdash;having with him two
Bedu of the Beni Asir, and the horses of all three&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good egg!"  John sits up on the string bed in his brown
camel's hair <i>kumbas</i>, grinning joyfully, and hugging his knees:
"Does one of 'em carry a reed-cage chock-full of pigeons,
strapped back of his saddle?  Think!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, verily, the Emir Fadl Anga being pigeon-master to one
of the Princes of Mecca.  Or such is the story that is told in
the Bazâr."  There is incredulity in the weary voice.  "He
hath brought the birds as a gift to the German General
commanding at Nazareth, for use, so they say, in the Intelligence
Department there.  When the pigeon-master Sergeant Major
comes from Nazareth, he will take them&mdash;and leave a cage of
birds that have been trained by himself.  All this I had in the
Bazâr....  Where art thou going? ..."
</p>

<p>
John, lowering his feet to the stone floor, and reaching for
his Arab head-cloth, very decidedly replies:
</p>

<p>
"To the Khan et-Talab, to dig out my man.  For he's my
man, this Fadl Anga."
</p>

<p>
"And how wilt thou get to the Khan, lame as thou art?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>I</i> dunno!"  John gingerly tests his bandaged leg: "You've
handed me a poser.  What's to be done?"
</p>

<p>
"What wouldst thou do, if it were possible for thee to go?
Think now and say! ..."
</p>

<p>
He rests his brawny arms upon his knees, and says, slowly,
as the fierce light in his black eyes dies out and leaves their
surface dim and lustreless:
</p>

<p>
"I'd find out which was Fadl Anga's room&mdash;loaf into the
courtyard among the horses, camels, goats, Arabs and Fellah
grooms&mdash;squat down under his window, and sing&mdash;not out
loud, but just between my teeth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Sagely she nods her little veiled head:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bouche fermée</i>,&mdash;some English song that is a sign agreed
upon between you.  Sing it me now, for I will go, and carry
thy disguised Englishman the message, while thou remainest
here&mdash;watching the soup that it be not burned or boil
over."
</p>

<p>
For all unnoticed while they talked, she has set a covered
earthen pot containing water, and some kind of meat that she
brought up with her, and has chopped fine and mixed with
herbs, amongst the glowing ashes; and a faint steam, not
unsavoury, is already beginning to spiral through the hole in
the knobbed lid.
</p>

<p>
"Is it agreed upon? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I should smile! ..."
</p>

<p>
She understands the odd utterance as assent and says with
a diamond sparkle between her veils:
</p>

<p>
"Now sing me thy song.  And give me thy message, but
otherwise advise me in nothing of how I am to do.  For, verily,
I am the Mother of Cunning as well as the Mother of Ugliness,
and have carried the lives of many men between these
hands of mine!"  Laughing softly, she stretches them out.
"And they are not as big as thy hands, my giant Cousin
John."
</p>

<p>
"You blessed little brick!"
</p>

<p>
He reaches out and captures in his own, one of the little
dusky hands, gently squeezes it, lets it go, and takes from
his neck a square of parchment that hangs there, suspended
by a slender green silk cord.  On one side are two interlaced
triangles outlined in thick black ink.  On the other a square
containing Arabic letters of the Sacred Name&mdash;within a double
circle in which have been traced and thickly inked&mdash;the Signs
of the Zodiac.
</p>

<p>
"That's that! ... Makes some Arab amulet, doesn't it? ... I
cribbed the figures from the title-page of Pittaker's
Almanac, and the Name off an inscribed tile.  Two letters are
stitched inside this&mdash;I've another letter hidden away inside my
<i>tarbûsh</i>, but that I'll deliver myself to Father Forbis.
Meanwhile, you're to get this somehow into Fadl Anga's hands.
If&mdash;but mind you not <i>unless</i> he tumbles to the first bars of
'Loch Lomond.'"
</p>

<p>
"Is it 'Loch Lomond'?  That was one of the English songs
we learnt to sing at my Paris boarding-school," says the Mother
of Ugliness.  "Hear now, O my cousin, if I remember it
aright? ..."
</p>

<p>
She has a little faded voice, sweet but thin, and in this she
sings to him the familiar refrain of the ballad that&mdash;hummed
by a battered private of London Territorials&mdash;sitting on a
captured bag of Turkish Army biscuits after Sheria&mdash;conjured up
the chintz drawing-room at Kerr's Arbour, and Katharine
Forbis singing at her piano in the twilight&mdash;before the stern,
absorbed eyes of an Arab who knelt at prayer....
</p>

<p>
So it follows that, having taken a sparing meal of bread
and fruit, and milk, the amulet containing the letters being
hidden upon her person, and the song stowed away in her head,
Ummshni-Esther sets forth, under the blaze of the sun of
twelve o'clock midday (going by the watch under Ali Zaybuk's
sheepskin wristlet, which is set at European time).  He limps
to the entrance of the tomb to let her out, and stands watching
until the little slender, veiled figure&mdash;wrapped in the ample
outer garment of coarse yellow-white sheeting, worn by Syrian
women, passes from his sight.
</p>

<p>
"Good luck to you, you regular little Maccabee!" he mutters.
"Now all You Big Old Men, butt in and help her! ... It's
up to you to help her....  For she's thoroughbred to the
backbone, if ever a woman was...."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Thud, thud&mdash;thud!  Thud thud thud&mdash;thud!  THUD!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The guns are still arguing heavily and persistently&mdash;in
the hills west of Jerusalem, and in the vicinity of Hebron....
South, over Junction Station, the inflated grey bulks of three
observation balloons wallow against the cloud-piled horizon,
over the huge ark-like hangars that kennel them, as the experts
in the dangling baskets read off, and transmit to their Headquarters
by Wireless, the silvery flashes of helios from the hills.
A Fokker biplane of pusher type with a Falk machine-gun
mounted in her bows, is trying to drive down one of the
observers; the rattle of the aviator's weapon sounding like the
clickett of a typewriter.  While a single-seater monoplane
<i>Taube</i> with a "Roland" bomb-dropping device, is endeavouring
to deal in a similar manner with the other O.B.'s, and a
British Anti-Aircraft gun mounted on a motor is spraying
vicious little shells of H.E. and shrapnel at the Germans, from
rapidly-changing vantages upon the ground below.
</p>

<p>
Even as John gets interested in the battle, the Fokker, hit
in her petrol tank by a projectile, suddenly vomits flame, and
drops like a singed moth, downwards.  The Taube departs in
haste for Hebron&mdash;seeing a half-squadron of D.H.6's coming
over from the aërodrome near G.H.Q. further down south....
Germany has few eyes in the air in these days, and the Turk
is well-nigh wingless.  But difficulties of transport threaten
to hold the British up at Nebi Samwil; and knowing this, the
enemy's resistance stiffens.  The sun will not sink on
Ottoman dominion in Palestine, while the Turco-German forces
hold the Jerusalem-Shechem road.
</p>

<p>
There is a glorious view from the summit of the Mount
of Cursing, silvered with streams on her lower slopes, clothed
with her groves of olive and almond, fig and apricot, orange
and pomegranate, as high as there is soil enough to hold their
roots.  Through a gap in the Hills of Galilee, snow-crowned
Hermon stands out in splendid relief against the deep blue
sky.  East, across the Jordan, are the Mountains of Gilead,
Osha's summit conspicuously capped with a streaming panache
of cirro-stratus; the coastal Plain of Sharon rolls emerald to
the turquoise lip of the Mediterranean, and the huge bulk of
Carmel thrusts out into the glittering distance a fortress
defying the uttermost assaults of Time.
</p>

<p>
"Some view!" John comments, baldly, in his acquired idiom,
narrowing his eyes under the hand that shields them from the
sun.  Yet in his heart he is drunken with the beauty&mdash;captive
forever to the spell of this land of Palestine....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Thud, thud!</i> ... BOOM! ..."
</p>

<p>
A colossal tree-shaped column of woolly brown vapour rises
in the west where lies Jaffa.  "We" are blowing up Turkish
ammunition-dumps and provision stores.

Great happenings are in the air.  Trained as John Hazel
is in the unimaginative school of London's Stock Exchange
and the City, his keen Oriental brain is quickened to this
consciousness.  Time, after many ripening centuries, is giving
birth to The Event foretold by and foreshadowed in prophecies,
dreamed of by vision-seers.  Can it be that after all these
centuries of exile, Christianity is to give back Palestine to
the Jews? ...

The onyx ring attracts the man's black eyes as he brings
down the hand that shaded them.  He tells himself that, after
all, he wasn't quite such a blooming mug as little Esther
thought.  He remembers binding a cotton rag about the finger
that wears the ancient heirloom, on the eve of the start from
Ismailia.  Somehow, the rag must have come off, either before,
or when, he jumped from the aëroplane, at the signal of Essenian.
</p>

<p>
"The treacherous Egyptian brute!  One of these days&mdash;"  There
is a promise in the hiatus that bodes ill for Essenian.
There is also a token, adhering to the ring, that bodes not
over-well for John.  Only a speck of bright green sealing-wax,
sticking in a fold of the lion-skin of Hercules, that was not
there when its wearer left the house in the Rue el Farad, to
dine with the Pasha at the Aviators' Club.

<h3>
IX
</h3>

<p>
The Khan of et Talab, or The Fox, is a thoroughly Oriental
caravanserai; flat-roofed, two-storeyed, and built upon three
sides of a square courtyard.  The ground-floor rooms are
deposits for travellers' baggage and stores, the windows of the
guest-rooms look out upon the courtyard, the fourth side of
which is a row of stables, with small rooms above them for
Arab and Fellah camel-drivers and horse-keepers, cooks and
scullions, and the tag-rag-and-bobtail of the Khan.
</p>

<p>
The rooms occupied by the Emir Fadl Anga, pigeon-master
to the nephew of the King of the Hedjaz&mdash;purveyor of
Intelligence to German Headquarters at Shechem, and owner of the
dapple grey Arab mare, are upon the top floor, and possess
the exclusive monopoly of the roof.  Thus the smells which rise
from the area of the courtyard and the harsh cries of itinerant
fruit and sweetmeat sellers, pedlars of fish, hawkers of bread
and vegetables; with the wrangling of servants and horse-boys,
camel-drivers and muleteers, washermen and scullions, are
somewhat tempered before they ascend to the nostrils and ears
of the Emir.
</p>

<p>
The room is large, whitewashed and fairly lofty, with a cool
tiled floor, on which are spread a few mats and Damascus
carpets.  Some stools, a few cushions, a low table; a carved
chest with a huge, wooden lock, and the inevitable divan, are
all its furniture.  Opening on a broad balcony communicating
by a staircase at each end with the housetop and the courtyard,
the high, wide window is also the door.
</p>

<p>
On the right-hand side of the divan nearest the window,
the Emir lies outstretched; pillowed on the embroidered saddlebags
which contain his travelling-gear, and smoking his water-pipe.
Its flexible tube snakes over the smoker's body, down
across the dark red tiling; the roseleaves dance in the water
that fills the glass vessel, the blue-brown incense of the good
Persian tobacco spirals up from the burnt clay bowl.  The
carrier-pigeons in their reed cage upon the shaded balcony outside
coo slumberously.  The <i>argili</i> gurgles as is its wont&mdash;the flies
that blacken the remnants of the midday breakfast of soup,
chicken stewed in rice, pancakes fried in fat and honey, melon
and figs&mdash;maintain a steady, persistent buzzing, and the rapid,
minute tap-tap-tap of small hard objects hitting the clean
starched cover of the divan never ceases.  For, if the King of
the Fleas of Palestine reigns&mdash;as is reported, at Tiberias&mdash;Abu
Brârit, the Father of Fleas, lives at Shechem.
</p>

<p>
Of the Emir's companions, a tall, grizzled, elderly Bedawi
in a purple and black <i>jelabia</i> with an ample white <i>jerd</i> swathed
over an orange silk <i>kuffiyeh</i>, and a short, broad-faced young
man, dark-skinned as a roasted coffee-berry, with a fine mouthful
of dazzling white teeth, and flashing black eyes, in a thin
<i>kaftan</i> of black camel's hair over an under-robe striped red and
white, with a <i>kuffiyeh</i> of white, bound with a green head-rope&mdash;the
junior squats on his heels beside a little stove of burned
clay in which glows charcoal, which is placed on the broad
balcony outside the window-door.  On the stove boils a
coffee-kettle of <i>repoussé</i> metal, whose fragrant vapours mingle with
the smells of the Desert, and the smoke of the Persian weed.
Meanwhile the little porcelain coffee-cups in their <i>repoussé</i>
metal holders, the coffee-pot, the mortar in which the berries
have been crushed, the brass pestle belonging to it, and a
lime-bark box of broken candy-sugar, sit naïvely on the floor.  That
the son of the Shaykh Gôhar, a noted leader in the guerilla war
between the King of the Hedjaz and the Sultan of Turkey,
should preside over the coffee-pot, is in strict accordance with
Bedwân etiquette.  For to drink coffee that has been prepared
by a woman, is a thing derogatory to masculine dignity.
Hence Namrûd, his striped mantle doffed, squats on his
slipperless brown heels beside the burning charcoal, and watches
the bubbling pot.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The coffee boils, the smoke spirals up from the thin, well-cut
lips, closed on the amber mouthpiece of Fadl Anga's
<i>argili</i>.
</p>

<p>
Of what is Fadl Anga thinking, as the roseleaves dance in
the bowl?  Some ancient Arab palace with palm-gardens and
apricot-groves sheltered from the sandstorms of the Dehna by
forests of cedar and oak-trees, shielded from the burning
winds that blow from the Gulf of Aden, by the mountain-ranges
of Hadramaut?  Of his horses and hawks, pigeons and
hunting-leopards, or of some slender bride, with gazelle-eyes
and henna-reddened fingers, and the rounded oval face that
Eastern Asiatics liken to the full-orbed moon....
</p>

<p>
Actually, Fadl Anga is watching a man in a shabby grey
tweed shooting-suit, burying the Service uniform of a British
field-officer of infantry, in a fox-earth in a wood.  A plantation
of snowy Scotch firs knee-deep in wintry bracken.  He has
rolled the things in a trench-coat, strapped with a sword-belt.
Now he savagely jams them down, and rises from the burial
of Edward Yaill, panting and with a streaming face, though
the wind has the nip of February....  He rubs the dry dust
from his hands&mdash;crashes to the stile through the frosty covert&mdash;leaps
out on the high-road.  And goes his lonely way, oblivious
that the end of the lanyard attached to the silver whistle
sticks out among the briars for Meggy Proodfoot's wee laddie
to pounce on by and by....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The flies buzz, the pigeons coo, the roseleaves dance in the
water-bowl....  Now through the smoke comes the low command
in the Bedwân dialect of the ancient Semitic language
that is even more archaic than the Babylonian Semitic of 6000
years ago:
</p>

<p>
"O Gôhar, Shaykh of the Beni Asir! and thou, Namrûd,
son of Gôhar! hearken to my word! ..."
</p>

<p>
"We hear, O Emir! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Friends, I have taken tracings of the despatch that was in
the bag, dropped by the airman who came at dawn yesterday,
and before sunrise I launched near Mount Gerizim, a pigeon
carrying one of these for British Intelligence Headquarters at
Lydd.  The wise old blue <i>dîk</i> with the crumpled foot, who
has served us well before, is my messenger.  Now, here for
safety's sake, is a duplicate tracing for each of you."
</p>

<p>
White teeth gleam in Namrûd's brown face as he takes the
filmy square of tissue paper, touches it to his forehead, and
says:
</p>

<p>
"O Fadl Anga! by thy favour, there is no place like the inner
whorl of the ear-rim, for hiding a paper rolled up within a
lump of bees-wax."
</p>

<p>
"O Fadl Anga!" the Shaykh's mimicry of his junior's
self-important tone is really creditable, "by thy favour, since the
clipping of the ears of spies hath not gone out of fashion, I
will hide the tracing thou hast given me, in a place that is of all
the safest, even beneath the eyelid of this my left eye."
</p>

<p>
"I will remember, O Gôhar!  Yet a little pride is permitted
when a young man hath carried out a stroke so cleverly."  Namrûd's
black eyes glow gratitude as the Emir continues: "Yesterday
there was consternation at the Shechem Headquarters
of General von Krafft, Chief of the German Secret Intelligence
Department on this front, when the bag dropped from the
aëroplane was opened, and found to hold a dummy message.  And
last night there was a smart young orderly Staff Sergeant-Major
of the Department&mdash;who was exceedingly sorry for himself."
</p>

<p>
"Thou shouldst have seen, O Emir! to taste the jest of it.
By Allah! 'twas like a monkey trying to carry two watermelons
in one hand.  Under the archway of the Street of
Mabortha, looking on the Square yonder," the dark hand of
Namrûd waves towards the rearward wall, "by the fifth
hour after sunset I fell upon my prey."
</p>

<p>
"Had I not known, I had been gulled even as the German."  The
tone of the Shaykh is not untinged with fatherly pride.
"When the old woman passed, and squalled like a peahen at the
gleam of the white face under the archway&mdash;and then took
courage because she found it fair! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast the wrong end of the stick, O my father!
She dropped in the mud a letter she was carrying from her
mistress, the wealthy young widow of Abu Husain the
jeweller, to the handsome soldier of Germany, who waited under
the arch."
</p>

<p>
"So, so, that was it!  And was there a letter? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, she could not find it, having trodden it into the
mud.
</p>

<p>
"True, it rained heavily yesterday morning.  And what kind
of a tale didst thou spin to tangle the dupe?"
</p>

<p>
"But this, that having seen him thrice, close upon the
blink of dawn, standing at his post under the archway,
the jeweller's widow had fallen into the very rage of love.
'<i>Her eyes, that were like torches, are extinguished with
weeping.  Verily thou wouldst have pity on her, O Sidi! if thou
couldst see.  Woe's me! this letter!</i>' (Thus I, the go-between,)
'<i>May the mercy of Allah defend me if I have lost it! for truly
she knew no better, poor demented creature!  than to wrap
up in it a costly ruby ring!</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha! ... That was well thought of!"
</p>

<p>
"It made my gull begin to hunt about in good earnest,
and, under pretence of the ring's having rolled, I lured him
farther down the street.  While with his little electric torch
he was groping amid the stenches of the gutter, I heard the
song of the Bird while yet afar off....  But cackling of lust
and vanity, and greed, now in one of his fat red ears&mdash;now
in the other, I deafened him,&mdash;else at a move, my grip had
fastened round his throat....  Then the signal pistol cracked,
and the orange light flared, and he grunted an oath:
'<i>Boppis</i>'&mdash;what tongue is '<i>boppis</i>'? ..."
</p>

<p>
Fadl Anga laughs.
</p>

<p>
"'<i>Potzblitz</i>,' it may have been...."
</p>

<p>
"And, like the pig he is, he charged for the archway,
knocking all the breath out of the old woman, who had got in his
way.  And while we twain rolled among the garbage on the
pavement, I, dealing him scratches and cuffs, and squealing,&mdash;but
not too loud! the second cartridge cracked out, and the
bag dropped into the Square...."
</p>

<p>
The Shaykh takes up:
</p>

<p>
"And I ran out from my lurking-place and changed it for the
dummy, ere the German floundered, snorting, from under the
archway....  He will be wiser in future,&mdash;if they ever trust
him further."  Gôhar lights another powerful cigarette.  "He
will lend his ear to no sugared tales told by old women&mdash;when
next he is waiting for despatches to drop out of the
sky...."
</p>

<p>
"It may be so.  But once a fool, twice a fool.  That is my
experience," says the quiet voice of the Emir.  "Now, friends
of mine, be it understood!  Our work here is done, with the
capture of the despatch, and the proof that Essenian Pasha is a
traitor to England.  To-night we throw the salaam to Shechem,
taking with us the English priest."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wallah!</i>&mdash;but that is good hearing!"  The Shaykh Gôhar
nods beamingly.  "My blood warms to the word of a raid.
Look at the boy!"
</p>

<p>
Namrûd is wreathed in grins as he squats on his heels&mdash;clearing
the boiling coffee with a dash of cold water, splashed
in at the critical time.
</p>

<p>
"He is thy very son.  Now, tell me once more, O Shaykh
Gôhar! what the War Prisoner officer told thee yesterday.
Secretly, at the <i>Mahatté</i> (Station) of Nakr, before the German
<i>Mudîr</i> came."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Masha'llah</i>!  At thy behest, O Emir! ..."
</p>

<p>
And the lean-faced Shaykh, sitting on a carpet beside the
divan, in his purple and black silk <i>jelabia</i> and silver-corded
orange head-drapery, smoking innumerable cigarettes of strong
Arab tobacco, re-commences the low-voiced tale:
</p>

<p>
"Thus, as I made pretence to bargain with him for a silver
cigarette-roller he had, that I said had caught my fancy,
he stoutly maintaining that he did not wish to sell&mdash;the
English officer said to me secretly at Nakr: 'The furrow watered
with our sweat shall yield us no harvest&mdash;yet are we not losers
but gainers thereby.  Since, refusing to give our parole to the
Turks, they shut us up in the barbed-wire enclosure without
the eastern gate of Shechem, we have taken it by turns to
scrape out a tunnel&mdash;working in shifts throughout the nights,
and taking it in turns to keep watch.  From the wooden hut
on the east side of the enclosure to the wire-fence is seven
paces of a man.  Inside the hut we began our tunnel, covering
the hole with planks nailed together&mdash;scattering earth upon
these, and setting the <i>anghareb</i> over the top, the better to
hide the place.  Two days ago we tunnelled under the wire.
Now we are well under the road that runs by the Tomb of
Yûsuf to the Well of Yakub, and so passes into the
Shechem-Jerusalem Road.  We are three paces south from the Turkish
sentry-box that is outside the wire there.  We should have
broken through to-night!"
</p>

<p>
"That would be the night of yesterday," Fadl Anga
murmurs, loosening his lips from the long amber mouthpiece.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Masha'llah</i>!  'But,' saith the English officer, 'that we heard
we were going to Aleppo for Exchange.  Now, finding thee a
friend in disguise, we would have thee know of the tunnel,
lest haply other War-prisoners&mdash;British or of the Allies&mdash;be
put in the Wired Place.  <i>Remember, the hole begins under
the earth-strewn planks that are beneath the </i>anghareb<i> in the
wooden hut that used to be the Mess, The tunnel passes three
paces south of the Turkish sentry-box that stands outside the
wire.  Four paces from the wire, where the broken-down
Turkish grain-cart stands upon the road</i>&mdash;it hath stood there
ever since the Taking of Beersheba and no man sets hand to
it!&mdash;under the grain-cart is where we should have broken
through.'  <i>Wallah</i>!  And they would have thrown the <i>salaam</i>
to the Turks and departed, but for the news of the Exchange."
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to God for men of good wit!  Did the officer
say no more to thee?"
</p>

<p>
"This, O Emir! that they had scratched the story with a
nail on the inside of a metal bowl and left it lying in the hut for
the next British prisoner.  In the bowl are written the times
when the Turks go the rounds by day and night; and the
hours for relieving-guard, and divers other things time served
him not to tell."
</p>

<p>
"But which," interrupts the younger man, proudly, "I, thy
son Namrûd have since found out...."
</p>

<p>
"Hence, to thee we owe it that we can make the essay
to-night, O Namrûd, rightly named 'The Hunter'!  Is the coffee
ready, thou cleverest of spies?"
</p>

<p>
"O Haji," Namrûd answers, tingling with the praises of
his hero, "the coffee is ready even now!"
</p>

<p>
The Emir wears a flowing <i>kuffiyeh</i> of vivid green silk secured
by the octagonal gold and silver head-rope, over his black
felt <i>tarbûsh</i>, so the title bestowed by the Shaykh's son is no
empty compliment.  The long Arab <i>jubba</i> under his loose,
open <i>jelabia</i> is of white silk, delicately stitched, the <i>jelabia</i>
is of heavy black brocaded silk, tagged with gold at the
seams, his red Arab slippers are gold-embroidered, there are
diamonds in the hilt of the curved, gold-sheathed dagger his
girdle supports.  It must pay uncommonly well to breed
carrier-pigeons for the nephew of the ex-Sherif of Mecca,
now by the right of descent from the Prophet; by the strength
of the sword (and the brilliant brains of an Oxford graduate)
Commander of the Armies of Arabia and of the Hedjaz,
King....
</p>

<p>
Now Fadl Anga lifts his slender, muscular frame, tense
and wiry even in repose, higher against the saddle-bags and
takes from the dark hand of Namrûd the little half-filled
cup.  The young man serves the Shaykh, his father; then, but
not until formally invited, fills his own cup, and they drink
ceremonially.  Twice the cups are replenished; then Fadl
Anga says, as Namrûd refills the clay bowl of the <i>argili</i> and
puts, with his tough-skinned fingers, a bit of glowing charcoal
on the top:
</p>

<p>
"Didst thou go to the <i>mashásheh</i> in the Bazâr, as I bade
thee, O Namrûd?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wallah</i>!  As thou didst bid me, I went to the <i>mashásheh</i>
in the Bazâr."
</p>

<p>
"And didst thou buy the drug&mdash;the sweet conserve of
hashish?  And of the tobacco-seller, giving him the discreet
wink, the cigarettes that are drugged with opium?"
</p>

<p>
"Verily, O Fadl Anga, these things I got, after the <i>magúngi</i>
and the tobacco-seller had denied for a long time that they
had any.  And&mdash;<i>Wallah!</i>&mdash;the cost of both was as though I
had bought jewels."
</p>

<p>
"It may well be, O Namrûd, yet I grudge not the money."
</p>

<p>
The Emir puts by the mouthpiece of his water-pipe, and
takes from the young Arab chief a stout package of thick,
rank-smelling cigarettes, with a Turkish label on it, and a
little sticky cardboard box of square, dull greenish jujubes,
saying with the smile that curves his finely-cut mouth under
the short henna-dyed beard, but never reaches his grey eyes:
</p>

<p>
"For, to a man who would pump a spy, or stupefy a
sharp-witted jailer, either of these were worth a handful of jewels."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Masha'llah!</i>" grunted the Shaykh, sending out a volume of
cigarette-smoke.  "Have I not proved that true?"
</p>

<p>
"Many times, O Shaykh Gôhar, and I also.  Now, son of my
friend and ally, go thou to the bath, which as thou hast found
out, the Turkish <i>Yuzbashi</i> (Captain) who will be in command
of the guard at the Wired Enclosure to-night, uses to-day,&mdash;his
duty commencing after the hour of sunset,&mdash;and challenge
him to a bout of wine and tobacco and salt stories to-night
in his tent.  His tent is on the left-hand side of the
Enclosure and serves by day as his office.  He smokes opium, and
his sergeant, who is his crony, is a drunkard, and they leave
the <i>onbashi</i> (corporal) to take roll-call and go the rounds,
whenever the two are minded for a fuddle"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"All Turks are dogs and sots!" the Shaykh says succinctly.
"Thou dost not forget the number of the guard at the
Enclosure, and the places where they are posted, O Emir?"
</p>

<p>
"They are inscribed in the register wherein I set down such
things."  Smiling, the Emir lightly touches his forehead.  "But
if thou wilt hear&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Masha'llah</i>!  Let it not be said that I doubted thee."  The
Shaykh holds up a lean, protesting hand.  "I, who am as
a suckling compared to thee in wit-craft, and the science of
hiving knowledge in the brain."
</p>

<p>
"Yet will I rehearse to thee here in the room, what Namrûd
learned, and thou didst tell me last night on the housetop.
Listen.  On guard at the Wired Enclosure, all told, thirty-four
men.  By daylight at any hour, eight Turkish <i>postas</i> on sentry."
</p>

<p>
"By Allah!  Plenty to guard one Englishman."
</p>

<p>
"As follows: One outside the Wired Enclosure at each corner.
One in the middle of each long side, north and south,
and two at the entrance....  The guard-tent is opposite that
of the Yusbashi....  Roll-call is in English time, 7.30 a.m. and 8
p.m.  The rounds of inspection are 9 p.m., 12 midnight, 5 a.m....
Three times between sunset and sunrise.  The <i>châwush</i>
(sergeant) makes them, if he is sober.  At other times the
<i>onbashi</i> (corporal) is left to carry-on.  The guard is relieved
every seventh hour, counting from sunset to sunset."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  But there was no need to repeat it all.  I am
humiliated by thy grace and courtesy.  Now, boy, thy lesson!"
</p>

<p>
"Hear then, O my father!"
</p>

<p>
Smiling, the dark-skinned Namrûd begins:
</p>

<p>
"There are eight <i>postas</i> continually on guard-duty at the
Wired Enclosure.  One at each corner outside, and one in
the middle of each long side, where there are sentry-boxes."  His
dazzling teeth flash, and his black eyes twinkle as he adds
demurely: "I have not heard the Emir tell that!  There are
two more <i>postas</i> on duty at the entrance.  Of the eight men
all told&mdash;who will be on sentry from sunset to daybreak&mdash;seven
smoke tobacco and drink wine, but one does neither.  He
is the priest of his platoon, and a Darweesh of the sect of
El-Hoseyn, the Prophet's grandson, and neither eats, drinks,
chews nor smokes, any of the Forbidden Things."
</p>

<p>
The Shaykh rolls his eyes cynically and spits:
</p>

<p>
"Wallah!  By the life of thy head!  A Darweesh and an
abstainer! ..."
</p>

<p>
Fadl Anga asks, narrowing his eyes to a grey, glittering
line:
</p>

<p>
"Thou art sure? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I have the testimony of the seven who are his comrades.
Not all of them love him, but notwithstanding, not one can
pick a hole in his coat."
</p>

<p>
"It needs a woman's little fingers for work like that!" suggests
the Shaykh, hopefully.  He pitches his last cigarette-stump
backwards over his shoulder, muttering: "<i>Dastûr</i>.  By
your permission, Ye Blessed!" in case of offending some Afrit
of the house, and rises from his carpet saying: "O Namrûd! it
is time for sleep.  Leave we the Excellent One to rest.  Fresh
talk will come after.  And there are yet two hours to pass
before thou goest to the bath...."
</p>

<p>
And so, with formal exchange of courtesies, and high
protests against the Emir's uprising, the Shaykh Gôhar and his
son assume their slippers and depart; leaving behind them the
perfume of sandal and musk and myrrh, mingled with the
wild chamomile and wormwood of the Desert, and the odour
of dressed gazelle-leather.  And Edward Yaill is free&mdash;for an
hour&mdash;to sleep and dream of Katharine....
</p>

<p>
It is grilling hot in the upper room of the Khan of the Fox,
and the mingled stenches of the courtyard intensify as it
approaches high noon.  The fleas hop, the flies buzz over the
unremoved <i>débris</i> of the midday breakfast....  Sleep still delays,
though Yaill has trained himself to summon the Healer at will.
In his brain the memory of a familiar refrain thrums in
insistent, maddening repetition.  He must yield, or sleep will never
come.  So under his breath he hums "Loch Lomond" so softly
that the hairs of his henna-dyed moustache scarcely flutter to
the measure.  And then, for a few moments, he appears to doze.
Until wakening, he stretches out a slim sun-browned hand, as
one who wistfully beckons, and whispers, yielding to the
craving of body and soul:
</p>

<p>
"Katharine, Katharine, where are you hiding? ... All
night and all day I have felt you near me.  Come out and show
yourself, my Sweet, my Sweet! ..."
</p>

<p>
But Katharine delays to reveal her bodily presence, though
that strange haunting sense of her nearness does not abate.
</p>

<p>
Yielding to the divine spell, Yaill holds out his hand, palm
upwards.  A pause, and he feels the light pressure of fine,
smooth fingers.  Hers! ... He shuts his eyes, and her breath is
cool upon the quivering eyelids.  Now she bends over him,
and for one rapturous instant, her mouth is upon his.  Now the
illusion passes, but it leaves his heart hungering.  He cannot
thrust the thought of Katharine from him.  He abandons the
idea of the noonday siesta.  He will write to his lost love.
</p>

<p>
And so Fadl Anga, otherwise Edward Yaill&mdash;takes from his
girdle his Arab pen-case, feels in a pocket within his <i>kaftan</i> for
a roll of coarse yellowish paper, tears off a suitable square,
and begins to write, using in correct if uncomfortable Oriental
fashion the palm of his hand for a desk.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAREST OF WOMEN,
</p>

<p>
Here in this Samaritan Khan of The Fox at Shechem, I
write to you&mdash;my two Arabs&mdash;Namrûd, the Hunter, and his
father the Shaykh Gôhar, of the Beni Asir, having gone about
their business, and left their supposed Chief in the state of
'<i>kef</i>!'  <i>Kef</i> proper, meaning a full stomach, a divan, coffee and
tobacco&mdash;incidentally everything else that affords gratification,
notably wine&mdash;and the Daughters of Eve.  I have eaten a
greasy Syrian midday breakfast, I lie on a divan apparently
stuffed with radishes, and evidently populous!  I smoke excellent
tobacco, and Namrûd's coffee corresponds in quality, but
there is no wine, and the One Woman earth carries for me,
her lonely lover, is some three hundred miles away.
</p>

<p>
"Beloved, these scrawled lines may never reach you!  But
there is news and I must write....  Yesterday, the War
Prisoners in this place, with the exception of some few too
sick to be moved, have been deported <i>via</i> Aleppo to Smyrna,
for purposes of Exchange.  Your brother's name has again
been excluded from the list.  Hamid Bey accuses him&mdash;I
heard last night&mdash;of instigating certain of the rank-and-file to
mutiny, and the slander is supported by witnesses suborned
by him.
</p>

<p>
"Julian has been secretly removed from the Barracks prison,
where up to the present he has been confined.  We could not
trace his whereabouts at first, but lighting on the fact that
34 Turkish rank-and-file were still assiduously guarding a
wooden hut at the eastern end of the rectangle of wired-in
ground outside the east gate of the city where War Prisoner
officers are no longer&mdash;we came to the conclusion, now proved
correct&mdash;that our man would be found there!  Pressure so
monstrous has been brought to bear, to compel him to sign
a paper, exonerating Hamid Bey from certain charges at the
expense of his own integrity, that our attempt at rescue will be
carried out to-night....
</p>

<p>
"Shall we succeed or fail?  What has Fate in store for us?
The answer to the question lies upon the knees of the gods.
You would scold me well if you were here, for so Pagan an
utterance&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The moving pen is arrested.  The keen ears of Fadl Anga
have heard the soft padding of naked feet upon the balcony.
The paper on which he writes vanishes, and with magic celerity
a half-written Arabic poem takes its place upon the palm of
the Emir's slender hand.  The pen moves from right to left,
as a shadow falls upon the paper.  The voice of a Fellah
servant breaks in upon the poet's reverie:
</p>

<p>
"O Saiyid!  O Emir, this slave craves permission to remove
the dishes!  Also there is a woman below in the court-yard...."
</p>

<p>
The flies rise with a roar from the rinds of the melons and
the greasy remains of the dishes, as the blue-shirted Fellah
waiter deftly lifts the tray, and poises it upon his head.
</p>

<p>
"A presumptuous one, who knowing that at this hour thou
wouldst be in the state of <i>Kef</i>, or under the influence of the
Healer, yet clamours to be brought before the Presence.  Wilt
thou that I bid her begone?"
</p>

<p>
"A woman, sayest thou?  Who is the woman, and what is
her business with me?"
</p>

<p>
The question is put with low-voiced indifference, the Emir's
half-closed eyes surveying the ceiling, now blackened with a
moving pattern of flies.
</p>

<p>
"O Emir, it is the Mother of Ugliness! ..."
</p>

<p>
"'Ummshni,' sayest thou? ... And who is Ummshni? ..."
</p>

<p>
"O Prince, Ummshni is known to every one.  Ummshni
is&mdash;Ummshni.  Touching her message, which greatly presuming,
she dared to send thee&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Out with thy message, O father of fools unborn!"
</p>

<p>
"O Master and lord, the message was this, thy slave kissing
the dust beneath thy feet for the sender's presumption: '<i>Tell
the Emir Fadl Anga that his greatness takes the high-road
and my humbleness treads the low.  But, in the matter of the
lost carrier-pigeon of whose whereabouts my lord deigned
to question Yuhanna Nakli, the Samaritan divineress in the
Bazâr</i>&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I remember.  Bid the messenger of the Samaritan divineress
come hither!"  The long lashes veil the Emir's grey eyes,
and as he speaks with languid pauses between the words, he
hears the measure of that well-known refrain in the throbbing
of his arteries and the beating of his heart: "Take away
the dishes and send her up here.  Or&mdash;"  There is a whiff of
myrrh and sandal as the tall slight figure in, its rustling silken
garments rises from the divan: "Here, from the window, point
her out to me!"
</p>

<p>
"O Prince, behold the daughter of Sheitan! dancing and
singing to the camel-men and horse-boys in the <i>haush</i> below."
</p>

<p>
The tall figure of the Emir steps out on the balcony as a
guffaw of coarse merriment comes up from the courtyard
borne on a stronger wave of stinks.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0410"></a></p>

<h3>
X
</h3>

<p>
A circle of Fellah grooms and Arab camel-men, coarse-mouthed,
evil-eyed, old in the ways of vice&mdash;are gathered about
a little creature in the dingy blue print robe, yellow-white
outer-robe of sheeting and coarse double veil of the Fellaha.
To the majority of these Ummshni is known, not so to the
others; who crowd round, eager to taste the joy of baiting the
veiled woman who has ventured alone into the crowded court
of the Khan.
</p>

<p>
"Hail, O Beauty, in search of a lover!" jests a squint-eyed
Arab.  "Couldst thou not pay an old woman to tout for thy
customers?  Has business been so bad that thou art driven
forth under the eye of daylight?  Nay then, show thy face for
a foretaste of pleasure.  <i>Insh'allah!</i>&mdash;unless thou art ugly as
a daughter of the Jinniyeh, here is Abu Mulâd the Tuareg
camel-man, ready and willing to take thee on!"
</p>

<p>
"The Daughters of the Jinniyeh have legs shaggy with hair,
and not seldom one eye in the middle of the forehead," squeals
a scullion, as Abu Mulâd, a huge and hideous Tuareg from
Central Sahara, whose face, arms and legs are dyed with indigo,
whose back hair is plaited in tails with straw, and whose
top locks are hogged like a cob's mane under the black tribal
head-cloth, is thrust into the forefront of the circle by a dozen
officious hands.  "While this moon's husband fell down dead
for sheer joy when his bride was first unveiled to him.  Is it
not the sheer truth, O Bestower of Delights?"
</p>

<p>
"Verily thou dost not lie, for once, O Kasib the scullion!"
says a thin but audible voice from behind the close-drawn
veil.  "Wilt thou risk the same fate, O Abu Mulâd the
Tuareg?  Then&mdash;then put forth thine hand! ... Or&mdash;shall I
save thee the trouble?  See then the face that killed a man
upon his wedding-night!"
</p>

<p>
With a thin, shrill cackle of derisive laughter, she draws the
screen of coarse towelling.  Abu Mulâd stares, grimaces
behind the strip of black cloth covering his mouth, curses and
spits copiously....  While the little active figure, galvanised
into sudden activity, revolves before him in an impish dance,
chanting to a weird, unholy tune, words in a strange,
unknown tongue:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "<i>O, you rode the Desert and he flew the Air!&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he has sent me to find you;<br>
  A message from him, and a letter I bear&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bonny bonny Maid of Kerr's Arbour!</i>"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There is something so gnome-like about the little capering
figure, revolving lightly as a withered leaf, or an eddy of
Desert sand, upon the unclean litter of the courtyard of the
Khan, that&mdash;and there is not one man of all the throng who
does not believe in witchcraft&mdash;even those who know Ummshni
best, quail at the possibility of falling under some evil spell,
blasting in its effect upon the body as upon the soul.
</p>

<p>
Kasib the scullion claps his hand before his mouth, as do a
dozen others, invoking the Protection.  But Abu Mulâd is of
the type of man that, ordinarily slow, dilatory and lumpish as
a buffalo, is rendered tigerish by fear.  He shakes in his hide
sandals and bleaches under his indigo mask as he splutters
through the V-shaped gap between his filed front teeth:
</p>

<p>
"Be thou accursed, thou one-eyed sorceress! abominable
ghoul, conceiver by the seed of devils!  <i>Insha'llah!</i> this good
blade of mine shall purge thee of thine evil blood!"
</p>

<p>
Not a man puts out his hand to save the woman, as the
Tuareg leaps upon her, grasps her frail shoulder, and the
curved iron knife flashes out, when a sharp clear voice, with
the unmistakable ring of authority in it, arrests the lifted
hand.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Shwai!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The whites of eager eyes roll, as the dark, excited faces are
lifted to the balcony where stands the Emir Fadl Anga.  Now
his sharp, authoritative voice rings out again:
</p>

<p>
"Release the woman and bid her come up hither.  Who
shows her violence will reckon with me!"
</p>

<p>
The Tuareg's heavy blue fingers fall from the slender,
bruised shoulder.  Ummshni mutely salaams to the imperious
Presence above, and moves with her customary, artificial limp
to the outer staircase leading to the balcony, as the crowd of
idlers, frustrated of the pleasant thrill that is born of the sight
of bloodshed, disperse to their various quarters.
</p>

<p>
Imperiously beckoning the woman to make haste, the Emir
moves back into the room, and presently the shadow of the
little feminine figure is cast across the balcony and the
three-inch high window-sill, that is grooved to receive the heavy
shutter that closes the room at night....
</p>

<p>
With a strange premonitory thrill, Yaill speaks to the little
creature:
</p>

<p>
"Enter without fear, O Mother of Ugliness!"  He goes on
as her fragile, dusky arms curve out, the hands touch the veiled
brow in the Eastern salutation from an inferior, and noiselessly
as a moth she flits into the room: "And without fear&mdash;for
here we are in privacy&mdash;tell me who taught thee that
song?"
</p>

<p>
"O Saiyid!"  How faint and whispering a voice is hers....
"I learned the song from a big man&mdash;-a soldier of the Army
of Ingiltarra&mdash;who sat on a sack of biscuits after Sheria, and
hummed while the Sons of the Desert made the Prayer of
Afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Where is the man to be found?"
</p>

<p>
"Saiyid, he lies in hiding in a tomb upon Mount Ebal, having
been lamed in leaping from a landing aëroplane.  His liver is
charred with anger at so untoward an accident.  Strong is his
brain to help thee plan, and strong as iron are his hands&mdash;that
could choke the life out of an enemy's throat&mdash;even as a child
twists a rotten cucumber.  But he is lame!"  Yaill marks the
falling note of anguished pity in the voice.  "He can but limp
upon a stick, he cannot leap or run...."
</p>

<p>
"Tell him from me.... Stay! ... Tell me first how thou
didst encounter him?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir," Ah, the woman knows too much, she is actually
speaking English, "Sir, to me, a woman of many sorrows,
secretly dwelling in that desolate place of which I speak, he
came as a stranger seeking succour.  Then, by the Will of the
Most High, was discovered between us kinship: the bond of
religion, the call of race, and the unbreakable tie of blood."
</p>

<p>
"Madam&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Give me not that title.  I am no man's wife!"
</p>

<p>
"Then, Miss Hazel&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Chut</i>!  Call me only Ummshni."  A black eye sparkles at
Yaill from between her veils and a little finger, slender and
supple as a lizard's tail, signs to him to beware.  "I heard a
footstep overhead, but now!" the thin voice whispers, reverting
to Arabic, "And it did not pass on, and see there&mdash;that
hole!"
</p>

<p>
With an upward gesture of her supple hand she barely
indicates the whitewashed ceiling, in which there is certainly a
hole, rat-gnawed, or made by human hands for spying
purposes&mdash;and reaching to the surface of the flat mud roof above.
</p>

<p>
"O Ummshni, there is a hole indeed, cleverly made for
eavesdropping, but the man who keeps guard above it is a
follower of mine.  Stay&mdash;thou shalt prove it so!"  Fadl Anga
whistles, shrill and sharp, the call of the pigeon-master; and
there is a rap on the roof above, and an answering, echoing
call.  "Now take a message for thy man.  Tell him from me,
that since by Fate he is doomed to be out of the adventure&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Give me a message worded in some other way.  I will
not wound him so!"  There is sensitive pride in the thin,
whispering voice.  "And first let me discharge mine errand.  Here
are the letters I spoke of in the song."
</p>

<p>
"Give, then," says the Emir briefly....
</p>

<p>
She draws from beneath her coarse white outer robe John's
square of sewn parchment-paper, inked with the signs of the
Zodiac, touches with it her veiled forehead, and offers it in
both her outstretched palms.
</p>

<p>
"The letters are stitched within, I was to tell thee.  And
that one of them comes from the hand of her&mdash;who is dearest
to thee of all!"
</p>

<p>
A great wave of emotion goes through Yaill, as he takes
the inky double square of soiled parchment-paper.  His hand
trembles for a moment, and there is a dimness before his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do not thank me, sir," the little creature quietly says in
her Paris-learned English, "I acted in obedience.  Shall I
not carry out the orders of him who is Head of my House?
Now give me the message to carry to John Hazaël in the
Mountain, for at dark I have business that brings me back
to this town."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I write, Miss Hazel, or shall you remember?"
</p>

<p>
"It will be safest not to write, and I shall not forget.  Tell
me in English, time and all....  It will be clearer for John
Hazaël, I being commanded to repeat your very words."
</p>

<p>
"Then tell John Hazel from Edward Yaill that I have
received the packet, and that as earnestly as ever man thanked
man, I thank him for what he has done!  To-night, between
twelve-thirty and two o'clock&mdash;European time&mdash;we break into
the Wired Enclosure.  We have learned of an easy way to get
in; and except for one man, who cannot be dealt with, I
think we can dispose of the guards."
</p>

<p>
"To-night between half-past twelve&mdash;no! ... Twelve-thirty
and two o'clock you break into the Wired Enclosure,
having learned of an easy way to get in...."  The tone is
studiously calm, but the throbbing of her heart shakes her.
"Is that all, or is there more to tell? ..."
</p>

<p>
"There is a tunnel running from the wooden hut that was
used as a mess-room by the English officers.  Do you follow?
It begins under the bed that is in the hut, and running
eastward, passes under the broken cart that stands near the side
of the road.  Five paces from the sentry-box of the man we
cannot deal with&mdash;the Darweesh who neither drinks wine nor
smokes."
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  But it may be&mdash;"  The talk has swung back to
Arabic, and the voice that is thin and soft as a trickling rivulet
of hill-water, sounds as though Ummshni's hidden mouth
were smiling behind her veil.  "It may be that Ishak Baba
the Darweesh, who drinks no wine nor tobacco, and cannot
be drugged into blindness&mdash;hath no strength to refrain his
lips from the offered goblet of love?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  So there is a weak place in his priestly garment,
that," Yaill remembers something the Shaykh Gôhar has said,
"that the little fingers of a woman might widen to a hole?"
</p>

<p>
"Verily, O Emir!  To-night when the Dark comes, Ishak
Baba going on guard at sunset&mdash;it is a pact twixt him and me,
that I, Ummshni, may feed the&mdash;the English prisoner, if&mdash;if
a shameless woman of the Bazâr, a gipsy whom Ishak Baba
loves&mdash;visits the Baba in his sentry-box.  I, Ummshni, keeping
watch the while."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Isht</i>!  (Bravo!)  O woman of a thousand!  Hast thou
carried the assignation to the gipsy courtesan?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, not yet."
</p>

<p>
"Then, do not carry it!"  The Emir's grey eyes gleam,
under the green silk <i>kuffiyeh</i> that drapes his <i>tarbûsh</i>, and
the thin lips under the henna-dyed beard curve into a smile
that shows his white, rather irregular teeth.  "One of my
men will keep the love-tryst, walking with a mincing, womanly
carriage&mdash;and swathed in the white <i>izar</i>.  Was the gipsy not to
pass the Baba on his beat, dropping an almond or a flower,
and before he wheeled about, slip into the sentry-box?  Dost
thou nod?  Ay, I well thought thou didst, it is an ancient
game!"
</p>

<p>
The Emir's white teeth gleam in his red-dyed beard, and
Ummshni gives her little mirthless titter.
</p>

<p>
"As my lord says, the game is old, but while Earth spins
between the Poles it will not lack for players.  One thing
there is to ask...."  The voice falters and the little figure
trembles.  "Thy man ... He will not kill the <i>posta</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  Do not tremble.  He will only gag him well, and
bind."
</p>

<p>
She gives a small sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
"There will be the green rods for him, the luckless
one! when the prisoner's escape is discovered."
</p>

<p>
The Emir's thin eyebrows mount in his bronzed forehead.
He says in his languid, high-bred tones:
</p>

<p>
"So there be an escape to find out, I am even content that
he should taste the <i>asayisi</i>.  I do not love Turks."
</p>

<p>
"Nor I, Saiyid!  But&mdash;" and another wave of shuddering
goes over the little shrouded figure: "since the ninefold curse
of War fell upon this my unhappy country, I have seen such
rivers of blood flow&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O lady, the whole world bleeds; nor shall its wounds
know stanching until the enemies of Peace are brought low.
They are the Turk and the German, and yet another who
wears the skin of many races, and plots evil in many tongues.
He works underground, and flies by night, and does not show
his face in sunshine; but when his hour comes, he will be
revealed!  Russia has the disease of him&mdash;and Ireland is rotten
with him!&mdash;and in India and the Far East the papers that bear
his teachings are cast abroad, and carried on the winds, and
shower down like the falling leaves."
</p>

<p>
"And here.  Even in this town&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The black eye sparkles between the folds of coarse towelling,
and the grey eyes lighten in an answering look.
</p>

<p>
"So! ... Thou couldst tell a tale&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Saiyid."  The eye-gleam is hidden in the folds, the tone is
humbly deprecating.  "I am only Ummshni.  Who looks over
his shoulder when a thing so despicable limps by with her
basket or <i>sharbi</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I understand.  Now, attend.  Tell your John Hazel that
we four men&mdash;I with my two Bedwân and Father Forbis,
ride out of Shechem before dawn, having the password and
making the pretext, that a carrier-pigeon being to fly for
Mecca at daybreak, we mean to launch her from the Mount.
There is a good chance that&mdash;Shechem being full of strangers&mdash;the
fourth mounted man of us shall pass unobserved.  But,
in any event, for us there is no turning.  Dost thou understand?"
</p>

<p>
The lean sunburned hand touches the butt of one of the
Emir's silver and ivory-mounted revolvers.
</p>

<p>
"O Saiyid, I understand!"
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Tell John Hazel to wait for us a mile west of
Shechem, where the Road of the Wady Azzun&mdash;going to Jaffa,
turns southward through a deep defile among the hills.  Is
that clearly understood, or shall I repeat it?"
</p>

<p>
"It is understood, and John Hazaël will meet thee, where the
road of the Wady Azzun, going to Jaffa, turns southward
through the defile among the hills."
</p>

<p>
"Can he, being so lame? ..."
</p>

<p>
"He can if <i>I</i> say he can.  I will see to it!"
</p>

<p>
"Then we will leave it so.  Near the mouth of the defile,
is a Turkish Army Service motor-lorry.  It broke down there
yesterday and it is there to-day.  Let Hazel wait in the
shadow of it, for the sound of our horses.  If we can get
a spare horse we will bring it.  If not, one of those we ride
will have to carry two men.  For Hazel is our partner in the
adventure.  We are not going to leave him in a hole!"
</p>

<p>
"I hear, O Saiyid! and I shall not forget.  By the broken
Turkish lorry where the road turns south, running between
the walls of the defile....  It is for Jaffa that you ride?"
</p>

<p>
"For Jaffa, where the British are....  Naturally."
</p>

<p>
Nationality unconsciously asserts itself in the tone.  She
answers in her whispering accents.
</p>

<p>
"There are British, five miles nearer here than Jaffa,
striking north from the Cross-Roads of Gilgal&mdash;over the levels,
and again west at Nebi Karen....  For there is the Tower
of Kir Saba, and Kir Saba is the Headquarters of&mdash;what
you call&mdash;a Mounted Brigade....  Not of soldiers from
England&mdash;but British of the Dominions&mdash;and yet not Australians,
though looking like them....  Dark, stern-faced men with
crimson bands and little green tufts on their soft brown hats&mdash;riding
little, thick-necked, active horses, sitting not loosely
as does the Arab, but close, as though horse and rider were
one."
</p>

<p>
"They are New Zealand Mounted Rifles.  You have
certainly a gift for detail, Miss Hazel."
</p>

<p>
The grey eyes of the Emir lighten appreciatively under the
Hajj's green turban.  The little veiled creature, as unmoved
by his praise as she was by the Tuareg's insult, goes on with
what she has to say:
</p>

<p>
"'Anzacs,' that is their name.  And since yesterday their
Headquarters is Kir Saba, whose Tower stands north from the
Cross-Roads two miles upon the slope of the hills.  The Turks
and Germans drove their trenches through the vineyards
and gardens, but, though they emptied the vaults, and
wine-cellars, and broke the refrigerating plant, they did not cut
down the orchards and olive-groves that stretch for miles
over the Hills.  They were wire-fenced and gated in the
time of Eli Hazaël.  Lest the wire should not have been cut,
or the locks of the gates broken,&mdash;I will place in thy charge
this key that I have here."
</p>

<p>
She is holding out to Yaill a clumsy metal spatula, evidently
the work of an Eastern hand.
</p>

<p>
"There are other keys upon the ring," she shows the
slip-ring of copper wire on which some smaller metal spatulas
are strung.  "They are the keys of the habitable rooms that
are on the Tower ground-floor.  We lived there part of every
year, during the Spring and vintage.  Turks having been
there&mdash;" the slight inflection given to the word conveys a
contempt that is boundless; "the rooms may contain nothing
that is fit for usage; yet were it otherwise, all is at the service
of my lord."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind!" Yaill says, more than a little
awkwardly, for one to whom the sonorous speech and stately
bearing of the Bedwân are second nature by now.
</p>

<p>
"By the Saiyid's leave," again Yaill has the impression that
the hidden mouth smiles coldly, "I speak of another&mdash;to whom
the Tower belongs."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes, of course."
</p>

<p>
Yaill is suddenly switched on to a fact he has forgotten:
</p>

<p>
"Of course, the Tower of Kir Saba and the land about it,
have been for many generations the property of the Forbis
family.  And Father Julian is the only living male heir.  But
how do you know?"
</p>

<p>
There is pride in the low voice that answers:
</p>

<p>
"Saiyid, though but a woman, I am of the race of Hazaël.
For sixteen hundred years and more our men have been
Keepers of the Tower and Guardians of the Shrine.  Thou
wilt deliver the keys to my lord?  It is a promise?"
</p>

<p>
"It is a sacred promise.  Pardon that I forgot!"
</p>

<p>
"Now I go back to carry thy words to John Hazaël on
Mount Ebal.  Then I return to Shechem.  At sunset Abu
Ishak goes on guard, at the end of the Wired Enclosure
where the wooden hut is, and when it is dark, I feed the
prisoner."
</p>

<p>
"Is it wise to risk so much for that?"
</p>

<p>
"Being a man," the little voice is very cold, "the Saiyid
speaks man-fashion.  Being a woman, descended from Her
who is the Mother of all men save Adam, I speak after the
manner of my sex.  How shall the lord of Kir Saba ride for
life&mdash;and over the hill-roads&mdash;if he be fainting?  Will he not
sit the saddle better if he be strengthened with broth and wine?"
</p>

<p>
"O daughter of our Mother Eve, wise art thou, and full
of forethought!  One thing before we part.  What time shall
the gipsy-woman come to the sentry?  It shall be for thee
to say!"
</p>

<p>
She thinks an instant, then says:
</p>

<p>
"When the <i>boruzan</i> of the guard sounds his bugle, and the
lights of the camp are darkened, let her come, stepping softly,
and pass the Darweesh on his beat&mdash;dropping a white flower,
or a piece of white paper&mdash;and then slip swiftly as a snake, or
a lizard, into the sentry-box.  When the Baba returns&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In the hope of finding waiting&mdash;the only one of the Forbidden
Things he hath not power to forego&mdash;he will kiss a gag
of oiled camel-hide, smooth and tight-fitting and greasy,
instead of his gipsy's hot, painted mouth.  She will come when
they sound 'Lights Out' at the camp of the Wired Enclosure....
And so, good-bye, Miss Hazel," says the Emir Fadl
Anga, and his sorrowful grey eyes are kindly as they rest
on the little shape.  "Forgive me for asking the question,
but under the circumstances&mdash;seeing that we clear out of here
to-night&mdash;what is to become of you? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Of me? ..."
</p>

<p>
She gives her queer, rustling laugh, and by the sound of it
he knows himself in the presence of a despair that is greater,
because more hopeless than his own.
</p>

<p>
"What becomes of the Dust when the puff of wind hath
passed over?  Does it not settle down again&mdash;to be trodden
underfoot by men?"
</p>

<p>
"But," Yaill feels something like awe of her, so small, so
desolate, so set apart, enfolded in her tragic sorrow, "at least,
in case of trouble at the gates to-night, you had better let me
give you the pass."
</p>

<p>
"I am Ummshni....  I need no pass! ... Again I am like
the Dust in this&mdash;that when men tread me underfoot I am
carried on their sandals, wherever I would go.  Farewell, O
Saiyid!  May the Most High preserve you and your
companions&mdash;and grant my lord deliverance by your brave hands,
to-night!"
</p>

<p>
And she is gone, and Edward Yaill takes a dagger from
his girdle, and rips open the inky, stitched-up double square
of tough parchment note.
</p>

<p>
Two letters tumble out of it into his eager fingers.  One
is in the familiar, beloved script of Katharine Forbis, the
other&mdash;the buff envelope, blurred with postmarks, patched
with stamps and scrawled with re-addresses he thrusts
carelessly into a pocket within his silk <i>kaftan</i>.
</p>

<p>
One shivers, contemplating the loss of that wonderful buff
envelope, and the consequent slip between the cup and the
lip.  But Yaill has no thought but this!  To him, on the eve
of the Great Adventure, has come a God-speed message from
his love....
</p>

<p>
"My Man of all the Men that walk this world!" she cries
to him.  "My full heart lies between your darling hands
to-night.  And your dear, dear letter&mdash;O Edward!  I have it close
to me.  It lies where my own love's head rested when we said
'Good-bye.'  You remember that sweet, sad parting in the
chapel at Kerr's Arbour? ... I shall never smell violets again,
or put on my mother's black lace veil to wear to Communion,
without going back in memory to that day ..."
</p>

<p>
It is a long letter, written all over eight pages, and running
along the edges of the filled sheets.  Love and solicitude and
anxious wistful yearning, overflow into the smallest corners,
curling and flourishing like tendrils of the vine.  It is not a
high-browed letter, nor even a passionate one, though pure
womanly passion throbs through it from beginning to end.  It
is Katharine in her fullest expression&mdash;and than Katharine,
Edward Yaill, her lover,&mdash;asks nothing better for this world
and for the next.
</p>

<p>
"Dearest," it ends, "John Hazel has promised to get this
letter through to you, and the other that I have written for
Julian,&mdash;and yet another that was sent to Kerr's Arbour for
you.  How strange that at the parting of our ways, so true
a friend should have risen up to help us.  With you I feel&mdash;more
strongly than I can say here&mdash;that this man is linked
with my Fate!  With 'our' fate, I would once have said&mdash;but
must not now, Edward.  Ah, though I do not speak or write
thus, I always think in the plural, dear! ...
</p>

<p>
"My own, though you make so little of it, you are in
danger.  An accent misplaced, an unguarded gesture&mdash;a twitch
of a muscle&mdash;might bring you Death.  If it add to your peril
to give you this&mdash;John Hazel has my authority to destroy it,
this letter that I have kissed where your dear, dear hands
should touch!  Julian's Rosary and your bit of asphodel I keep
where I can feel them, as I go about my business of driving
cars in Egypt for our Red Cross.  Thank God, I have lots
to do!  And I do it, as well as I can, with both of you tugging
at my heartstrings,&mdash;lie down to sleep with a prayer for you
on my lips&mdash;wake in the night, crying for joy, because I have
dreamed that you are safe, and we are happy as we used to
be.  And rise to another day of anxiety and loneliness....
</p>

<p>
Oh, well! it can't go on for ever!  Even suspense like this
must come to an end.  God keep you both, my Precious Ones! and
bring you back safely to&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Your loving, faithful, anxious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"KATHARINE."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yaill reads the letter three times and kisses it lingeringly.
Then he puts it carefully away.  With certain other documents,
maps and diagrams of fortified places, tracings on silk
tissue-paper, and two or three other letters in Sanscrit and
Arabic, in a small flat case of tough glass, double, and
metal-jointed; covered with green gazelle-leather, stamped with an
Eastern design.  The flat paper-case closes hermetically; and
a twirl of a stop-screw liberates the acid contained in a
reservoir at the top.  Thus, its contents may be destroyed,&mdash;or
rendered completely illegible, at the will of the agent who carries
the case....
</p>

<p>
At the last moment Yaill remembers the buff envelope, brings
it out, turns it over and sniffs at it....  It exhales no cheap
and violent perfume, displays no gaudy monogram....  The
handwriting, large, flourishing and square, is quite unknown
to him, and yet&mdash;as it lies under his incurious eyes, the
image of his wife, Lucy Yaill&mdash;once Burtonshaw&mdash;is flashed
upon his brain.
</p>

<p>
He will not open the buff envelope just now....  The thing
with its English superscription, being dangerous to carry, he
puts it away with the other papers in the glass-lined case,
one twirl of whose lever-screw can blot out words, penned
in the sprawling hand, that mean Hope renewed, Happiness
restored, Union with the woman so faithfully loved, a blessed
possibility&mdash;granted that Katharine's tender prayers for her
beloved's protection and safety are heard, and answered
soon....

<h3>
XI
</h3>

<p>
A huge Arab, mounted on a very little ass, ambling along
the stony roads while a woman trudges in the dust behind
him, is so common a spectacle in Palestine as to occasion no
remark.  Were the positions reversed,&mdash;did the woman ride
the donkey and the man tramp after, then by so unprecedented
a breach of etiquette, popular comment would naturally
be provoked.
</p>

<p>
After the fashion indicated above, Ummshni, conjuring the
little beast from some source unknown, has conveyed her man
to Fadl Anga's appointed meeting-place, a mile west of
Shechem, where the road of the Wady Azzun, switchbacking
down to Jaffa&mdash;or more properly Gilgal&mdash;turns southward,
running down a steep-sided defile among the hills.  There,
where the broken-down Turkish motor-lorry stands by the
roadside, she has left him, taking with her a cherished asset
he has carried hidden about him, in the shape of a pair of
insulated wire-cutters.  Her parting words still sound in his
ears:
</p>

<p>
"Thou art the Head of our House, my cousin.  Bless me
before I go! ..."
</p>

<p>
Now John tingles with a scalding sense of her worth, and
his own unworthiness, as he remembers how he put his heavy
hand on the small veiled head, and muttered some incoherent
words.  Then she turned, and went from him so quietly that
he has barely realised the risk that she is taking.  Now that
she has gone, it comes sharply home to him, and salt stinging
moisture gathers under his eyelids, and a lump is in his
throat.
</p>

<p>
The little donkey, hobbled by Ummshni before she went,
to prevent its straying, grazes contentedly by the roadside,
where rich green weeds, and grass and brake, and clumps of
late-flowering asphodel betray the presence of moisture in
the soil....
</p>

<p>
The sides of the hill-pass opening here, are chocolate-brown
where the soil shows bare, as those of any cliff at home in
Devon or Somerset, and trickling with little streams,
thick-fringed with maidenhair....  Snapdragons of many hues,
cyclamen white, and violet, and pink, spring in the crannies
of the rocks, with the purple amaryllis, and a smell suggesting
violets is sweet upon the air.
</p>

<p>
It is close upon the hour of sunset now.  There is a great
view here, from the top of the stiff up-gradient that climbs
up from Shechem to plunge in a long series of downward
curves, westward towards Jaffa, until, Gilgal reached&mdash;it turns
at an acute southward angle and leaps the Cana Road.
Nobody comes, though Turkish cavalry patrol the wadys at
irregular intervals, and there are outposts with machine guns
among the hills.  Save for the thudding of those restless guns
south-west and east, it would be even sweet and peaceful.
For the air is divinely spiced with that rare perfume that is
so like the smell of violets; the orange-winged Syrian
blackbird pipes out his good-night song; and every thorn, or
wild-olive, or mulberry-tree of all that mantle the sides of the
defile, seems to accommodate its pair of bulbuls, warbling
and jug-jugging in the very rage of ecstasy&mdash;sometimes breaking
off to mew&mdash;after the provoking habit of nightingales.  And
John Hazel lights another strong Arab cigarette, swings
himself to the driver's seat of the broken-down Turkish motor-lorry,
and for a brief space, listens and smokes, and thinks....
</p>

<p>
He recalls the great experiences of War, forgetting War's
miseries and discomforts.  The social joys of the camp-fire,
the long, confidential talks of the bivouac, the short, hard
hand-grip pals exchange before going into action; the parting
kiss that a soldier may set on the lips of a dead or dying
friend.  Men have seen men's souls face to face in the midst
of hideous slaughter&mdash;in the pauses between horrible
explosions&mdash;and until the heavens are rolled up as a scroll, and
the sea is dry from shore to shore&mdash;and the Earth stops
spinning between her poles, they will not forget these things....
Perhaps not even then....
</p>

<p>
And then John's thought goes back, as it has not done for
long, to the thriving Firm of Dannahill, Lee-Levyson and
Hazel, Insurance Brokers, of London City; and Beryl Lee-Levyson,
John's former love&mdash;Muriel, Beryl's sister, and his
brother Maurice&mdash;now piloting a Handley-Page bombing 'plane
on the Western Front, Old Mendel, and Miss Birdie Bright,
pass in imagined rotation over a stage, oddly backed by a
composite drop, in part representing the Underwriting Room at
Lloyds, the Office in Cornhill, and John's bedroom at
Campden Hill....
</p>

<p>
Dannahill, still haggard from the shock of his grandson's
death, (the wire had only come from the War Office that
September morning) and Lee-Levyson and Copples the Senior
Clerk, are shaking the Junior Partner's hands, as he comes
out of his stuffy little office with his working coat in a brown
paper parcel, containing a lot of odds and ends, some pipes,
and Beryl's tinted photograph in a flamboyant silver frame.
John is in a full suit of pink-striped silk pyjamas, and there
too is Mrs. Hazel, John's mother, handsome in her pale blue
<i>crêpe</i> dressing-gown, with her still abundant auburn hair in
a thick plait down her back.  To her John hears himself
saying in his acquired British accent:
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, if the Pater was a Syrian Jew, your governor
was British enough, anyway!  Symes sounds like a good old
English name."
</p>

<p>
And the answer comes like a douche of cold water on his
secret hopes&mdash;like a crunch on the pill deftly concealed in the
middle of a spoonful of jelly:
</p>

<p>
"That was why your grandmother adopted it.  After your
grandfather's death, of course.  His name was Simonoff....
A Russian Jew from Moscow...."
</p>

<p>
The chill of the cold water, the bitterness of the pill.  How
John Hazel has shivered at the one and grimaced over the
other.  Some shock! to learn that between the Jew of
Palestine and the Jew of Greater Russia he has been wrought all
Jewish.  That not one globule of British blood mingles with
the strong Semitic tide that gallops through his veins....
</p>

<p>
And now&mdash;though his big body sits still and smokes, his
spirit is abroad to-night on these hills of Samaria.  He snuffs
the sweet wild November breeze with wide, distended nostrils,
and shows his big white teeth in a silent laugh.
</p>

<p>
This Hither Asian land of Syria....  How he has despised
and belittled it&mdash;this Garden of Miracles from whose teeming
soil&mdash;burrowed by a nation of cave-dwellers and idol-worshippers,
and tracked by the footprints of nomadic shepherds&mdash;prophets,
sages, seers, philosophers, poets, musicians, artists,
architects&mdash;leaped into birth at the Divine Bidding, while as
yet the world was a jungle of ferocious human beasts....
This Palestine, no bigger than the County of Middlesex, in
Religion, History, Science, Law, hygiene and moral teaching&mdash;has
she not ever led the way and pointed to the zenith?
What if her star, after long eclipse, should now be in the
ascendant?  Strange, strange, if after all the centuries of war,
exile and oppression, Christian hands are to give back
Palestine to the Jews! ...
</p>

<p>
He hugs himself, muttering:
</p>

<p>
"A hell of a country to get hold of you, and no mistake
about it.  But she is IT, this little old Palestine!  She's got
it in her to whack the globe&mdash;given the men and the money.
I'm one of her men....  I've got some money.  And it's going
to be spent with lots more to set her going again.  Golden
blood pumped into her veins to set her heart beating&mdash;and
make her buried splendours, her Temple with its golden dome,
her matchless Holy City&mdash;her towns, and gardens, and
hippodromes and palaces jump out of her yellow soil as quick
as mustard-and-cress."  He chuckles.  "I'm a bit potty! ... 'Fey,'
a Scotchman'd call it....  I feel as if all my Big
Old Men&mdash;those dead old Hazaëls&mdash;right away down from
the Kings of Damascus who laid siege to Ahab, King of Israel,
and afterwards joined up with him against the Assyrians!&mdash;were
alive and swarming over these hills of Samaria to-night...."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the man, in his normal state, is oblivious of the
postscript he supplied to the story of the inscription on the
tablet.  He may not know the blood of the Hazaëls is tinctured
with the Israelite blood of Istâr the Princess, daughter of
Jezebel of Tyre and Ahab of Samaria.  Half a mile north of
where he sits on the lorry,&mdash;parallel with the road to Gilgal,
runs the great seaward-going road of the Wady-es Sha'ir,
forking off at Anebta, past the Watch Tower hill of Omri,
to Carmel and the sea.
</p>

<p>
From her nest of purple cushions in the high balcony-window
of her ivory palace at Samaria, Jezebel, Ahab's Queen,
daughter of King Ethbal of Sidon, looked&mdash;when her people's
god, red as though dyed with the blood of the murdered
prophets&mdash;was blotted out of sight by the rising curve of the
earth....  Famine withered the rainless land, and beasts and
men were perishing, as the Prophet of the Most High lay
prostrate on the summit of Mount Carmel, pressing his face
against the sod....
</p>

<p>
"<i>And while he turned himself this way and that,</i>" as a
worm might writhe in anguish, the little cloud rose out of the
sea.  And the troubler of Israel rose up and sent word to King
Ahab:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Prepare thy chariot and go down, lest the rain prevent
thee!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Over this broad Road of the Wady-es Sha'ir, the fleet horses
of Ahab's jewelled ivory chariot thundered, as "the heavens
grew dark with clouds and wind, and there fell a great rain."  And
the King raced down to Samaria before the pelting storm,
while the lean prophet, the swift Hound of God, scoured fleetly
on before....
</p>

<p>
And Elias, being threatened with the vengeance of Jezebel,
because he had killed the priests of her golden temple of Baal
Zebub, fled south to Beersheba, and being miraculously fed,
journeyed to Horeb, and lived in a cave.  And after the
Vision on the Mountain, returned by the Divine Command
through the desert to Damascus, and anointed Hazaël of
Damascus to be King of Syria....
</p>

<p>
Now John, lineal descendant of the race,&mdash;inhales the rank
smoke of his Arab cigarette, and pursues his train of thought.
Sitting on the broken-down Turkish motor-lorry, with knees
drawn up to his long chin, and his long arms hugging them;
with his Arab head-cloth pushed awry, and prickly burrs
tangled in his coarse black hair, that is powdered with
limestone-dust like his mahogany skin&mdash;the huge man with the
great nose and the fierce black eyes that blaze under their
bushy, knotted eyebrows, is an awesome spectacle&mdash;having
much more in common with the lean and dusty Prophet than
with his own remote ancestor the Baal-worshipping King.
</p>

<p>
He is engaged, as he sits there, in a death-struggle with the
strongest and most ruthlessly selfish of all human passions.
That smell of violets brings Katharine back&mdash;dwarfing as great
artists will&mdash;every other player on the stage of his mental
theatre.  He sees her on a certain February day, standing
in the chintz-hung drawing-room looking on the terrace at
Kerr's Arbour, with a bunch of greenhouse violets in her
beloved hand....
</p>

<p>
"I was going to take him these....  Perhaps you would
like to?" she had said, giving the violets to John....  Then
he followed her up the little aisle of the chapel, and stood with
her beside the General's long coffin, looking down at the grand
old face, and the rigid clasped hands....
</p>

<p>
"Father, dear, this is a friend of ours, whom you have
wished to see!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Again he hears her, speaking as though the old man
were not dead but in a quiet slumber.  She touched his hand
in showing him how to place the violets under the rigid fingers,
that held a Crucifix and had a Rosary threaded between....
</p>

<p>
On that first day she seemed to John, older, graver, sterner
than afterwards, when Edward Yaill came upon the scene.
He remembers how their eyes met, and she kindled into beauty.
He recalls his brief, stern interview with Yaill, and that
parting "Carry on...."
</p>

<p>
He conjures up the Funeral, and Katharine veiled and
draped in black&mdash;offering him in a silver shell some earth
from Palestine to sprinkle on the coffin.  He recalls her
summoning telegram, and the finding of the khaki kit of the
"Missing British Officer" hidden away in the fox-earth in the
wood.  He glows again with joy as she comes to greet him
at the Hospital, beautiful, strong and womanly, in her
uniform of cool white drill.  He welcomes her to the
cradle-house of her Roman race, the House of Philoremus Fabius,
on the ancient Street of the Four Winds, now lost in the Rue
el Farad.  Again he waits for her outside the Chapel of the
Shrine, again they sit on the granite seat under the moss-cup
oak.  And once more he thrills exquisitely at the velvet touch
of her warm, sweet mouth upon his clumsy hand.
</p>

<p>
It was a cruel thing to do, but she had no thought of
coquetry.  He knows that the kiss was a belated tribute from
a woman of her race, to the last male Hazaël but one.  That
she looked past the recipient of the kiss to the huge, swart,
bearded ancestor, who first held the onyx ring in trust, guarded
the Title Deeds, and preserved the house at Alexandria&mdash;and
the Tower of Kir Saba in Palestine, to be handed down, a
sacred charge&mdash;by his children's children, and their children,
down to the present day....  A tribute of gratitude and
respect, that kiss, and nothing further.  But it was set by a
woman's mouth upon the hand of a man....
</p>

<p>
He knows that there is no hope for him, this ungainly
worshipper of Katharine, even though her lover should never
be free to marry her&mdash;though the tie that binds Yaill to Lucy
Burtonshaw should endure for both their lives.  He, John,
has hated Yaill with the virile strength of jealousy.  He has
conquered that baseness in himself....  He hates the man
no more....  He has risked and borne much to carry Yaill
her letter.  He has been even warmed and heartened by his
enemy's gratitude:
</p>

<p>
"Tell him that I have received the packet, and that as
earnestly as man ever thanked man, I thank him for what
he has done! ..."
</p>

<p>
But even with Yaill's message fresh in mind, John is not
cured of hoping.  He hopes&mdash;and sets his huge foot upon the
neck of his hope&mdash;while yearning over it as a man may yearn
over his first-born.  For this that has come to him is the
knowledge of true Love, and even as Jacob in old days wrestled
with the Angel,&mdash;John Hazel strives with his masterful,
bright-winged passion&mdash;not trying to detain Love, but rather to
compel Love, by force of thews, to go....
</p>

<p>
The blood-red sunset glorifies the West, fills the defile from
cliff to cliff, and now smoulders out in amber and jade-green,
peacock blue and rose-madder.  Grey twilight comes&mdash;and the
birds are still, as a giant owl flies over, and sinks, as a shadow
sinks, amongst the shadowy trees....  No one draws near.
The cavalry patrols of the Turk are oddly infrequent on this
particular Shechem end of the Jaffa-going road....
</p>

<p>
John gets up and shakes his dreams and hopes and memories
from him, as a swimmer emerging from a sluggish stream
might shake off clinging weeds.  His hopes are scarcely weeds.
Rather are they trails of blossoming lotus or water-lily.  But
lilies or weeds, they hamper.  And there is work to do.
</p>

<p>
He stretches himself, shakes his giant frame, pitches away
the stump of his cigarette&mdash;gets down from the driver's seat,
climbs into the body of the lorry and proceeds to inspect the
boxes that form its load.  They are heavy wooden cases
roughly dovetailed together, painted a dirty stone-blue and
grossly daubed with the Crescent and Star in bright vermilion
paint.  They are branded with the initials of the Turkish
A.S.C., carry the stamp of the shell-factory at Makrikeui,
and belong to the 2nd battalion of the 4th Infantry Regiment,
(Headquarters Salonika) of the IIIrd Ottoman Ordu.
</p>

<p>
John thinks it would be as well to have a look inside a few
of those blue boxes, with the assistance of a spanner, and his
pocket electric torch.  He looks about for a spanner and
presently finds one in the tool-box aft of the driver's seat.
It is a large spanner of good steel, and&mdash;in the hands of John
Hazel&mdash;makes a most efficient substitute for the key of the
Turkish lock.  The nails draw, the wood splinters, the lid is
lifted....  The box&mdash;instead of being full of packets of
Mauser cartridges, proves to be packed with metal spheres
the size of biggish cricket-balls, painted a bilious brown....
</p>

<p>
"Bombs ..."  With a thrill of pleasurable recognition
John picks up one of the cricket-balls and weighs it in his
hand.  "Our make too.  Some find!" he thinks.  "Now, where
did they get these? ... Snapped up a string of mules at the
tail of an ammunition-convoy, or found 'em in some
abandoned dump on the Peninsula, when the Expeditionary Army
evacuated Gallipoli! ... Anyhow they come in handy.
Damned handy! ... Let's look in another box...."
</p>

<p>
He breaks open four more, with the assistance of the
spanner.  Two out of the lot hold bombs, British-made, pitched in
higgledy-piggledy, with the recklessness that may be born
of Mohammedan fatalism.  The others prove to contain paper
clips of cartridges, marked for use in the 1890 pattern Mauser
magazine-rifle of 7.56. mm.
</p>

<p>
Two boxes of British bombs, at this especial juncture, come
to John Hazel as manna from the skies.  If there is a weapon
the ex-insurance broker of Cornhill prefers before all known
devices for killing other men&mdash;that weapon is the bomb, of
the cricket-ball, hand-pitched variety, that makes of one
long-armed man, the equal of many men armed....
</p>

<p>
At Rondes Poix in the March of 1915, a party of Fenchurch
Street Fusiliers being hemmed in at an advanced post by the
enemy, Private Hazel and Private Spurge&mdash;a rival star-artist
in the line of effective bomb-throwing&mdash;kept the Hun at bay
for eleven hours by pitching cricket-ball bombs.
</p>

<p>
Again, in the April of that year, east of "that mad place
called Ypres," John, possibly urged to derring-do by the
urgent spirit of Sergeant Harris, and armed with a bag of
bombs of this variety&mdash;crawled through a hole in the enemy's
barbed-wire, and single-handed&mdash;argued in such wise with
the Germans established at a certain machine-gun position,
that the Fenchurch Streets&mdash;charging over the front-line
parapet at the critical moment, were able to clear three hundred
yards of the trench in question, and held the same triumphantly
for the rest of the fighting day.  The D.C.M., that silver disc
bearing his Sovereign's bust, which he calls his "bit of tin"
and is secretly vain of,&mdash;was subsequently bestowed on Private
Hazel when a patient at the Auxiliary Military War Hospital,
of Colthill, Middlesex, in recognition of this feat.
</p>

<p>
"Given they're not duds," he murmurs now, lovingly toying
with the spring-pin of one of the cricket-balls, "I could hold
up a half-battalion of Turks with these, until the cows come
home! ..."
</p>

<p>
He looks up to his left and right, roughly estimating the
height of the defile, the perpendicular walls of which are
somewhat lower on his left than on his right-hand&mdash;and calculates
the width of the road here at under twenty feet.  More
like eighteen-and-a-half.  Well, given that to-night's attempt
at the rescue of Father Julian Forbis does not prove a
washout&mdash;here is the wherewithal to keep the road, in case of a
pursuit....
</p>

<p>
Twilight creeps on.  The crickets chirp, and noiseless as
a shadow, the great owl slips from the thicket and takes his
soundless flight.  The little owls hunt in the grass for frogs,
lizards and beetles, and the great bats come out of the
crannies in the rocks to gorge themselves with fruit.
</p>

<p>
For a while the guns have ceased to argue, and the night
is still and breathless; not the clear violet night of Syria,
radiant with dazzling silver light of moon and starshine, but a
moonless night of semi-obscurity, and diffuse and formless
shadows, with menacing rumbles of thunder in the east,
where sheet-lightning flickers now and then.  Venus suspends
her sapphire lamp above the hills of Judæa, and the Pleiades
shine almost directly overhead.  Bright-armed Orion rises in
splendour over the ramparts of blue-black cumuli that brood
in the east over the Mountains of Gilead.  Low down, through
a jagged cleft in these, twinkles the star Y Crucis, that forms
the summit of the Southern Cross....
</p>

<p>
No trot of hoofs on the stony road draws nearer from the
eastward; no clink of spur on scabbard, or bit against
chain-bridle, tells of the approach of a cavalry patrol along
the Jaffa Road.  There are yet three hours and more to wait
for the sound of hoof-beats coming from Shechem, that may
signify the escape of the prisoner from the Bey's wire cage.
</p>

<p>
Does all go well?  Has Esther Hazaël carried out her
stratagem?  She has shown John how&mdash;when the Dark comes
down&mdash;she will feed the prisoner.  By a device almost absurd
in its direct simplicity&mdash;used, in this Eastern land, millions
of times ere now.  Women are cunning in such tricks, and
full of subtle resources....  Well for men that it is
so!&mdash;especially in time of War....
</p>

<p>
Ummshni is at her business now.  John feels certain.  He
nods to himself, solemnly, and sitting on the lid of one of
the broken bomb-boxes, folds his great arms, narrows his
eyelids and sends his Thought ranging abroad in search of her.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he sleeps and dreams, sitting there.  Who knows
whether he does or does not.  But after some moments of
silent concentration, he sees his messenger go forth.  A tiny
thing&mdash;human in form, light as a puff of thistledown, no bigger
than a locust&mdash;it leaps down to the big Jew's knees, and thence
to the bottom of the lorry; drops from it into the dust and
scours down the road.  Swift as the wind, it passes over the
highway&mdash;reaches the west gate of Shechem and slips through
a crevice in the ponderous iron-studded timbers, lodging
between the sandalled feet of the Mustahfiz infantry guard....
Now it goes by the Khan of the Fox, darts through the square
where the archway is (under which the Orderly Staff
Sergeant Major of the German Intelligence Department waited
for the dropping of the despatch-bag from the Two Faced
Nightingale), traverses the town, thronged to-night with
variously attired strangers of many nations, and&mdash;lightly as a
withered leaf, and inconspicuous as a dust-swirl&mdash;traverses
the main thoroughfare of the ancient town.
</p>

<p>
Shechem is packed to the walls to-night with the exiles from
Jerusalem.  And in addition to these, with strangers in
foreign clothing, diverse in type, sinister-faced and stern-eyed,
speaking unknown languages....  There are many Turkish
officers, young and old, in uniform and out of it, and German
officers of many ranks and decorations, accompanied by
women, painted and overdressed.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So many strange feet, bringing strange dust from strange
lands.  Yet the little thing no bigger than a leaf finds a way
between them all.  Now it spins out at the east gate and rolls
down the rutted road towards the Wired Enclosure....  Here
storm-lamps hang outside the guard-tent and on either
side of the entrance.  The officer's tent is lighted within, but
unlike the tent of the <i>postas</i>, it is furnished with a door-flap.
From inside comes the sound of laughter, the clinking of
glasses, and unmistakably, the rattle of shaken dice.  Near
the gate, in conversation with the <i>bash-châwush</i> of the guard,
stands a tall, thin, elderly Bedawi, known to the reader as the
Shaykh Gôhar.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay!  Do not trouble the <i>Yuzbashi</i>."  He waves a
hand in the direction of the tent whence comes the convivial
clink.  "The affairs of the humble must wait upon the leisure
of the great ones.  Yet if thy dignity were not lowered by
the mention of a hundred piastres&mdash;one <i>lira</i> Osmanli&mdash;"  Gôhar
carelessly displays the coin.
</p>

<p>
"O my friend!  O my soul!" hiccups the <i>bash-châwush</i>, who
at this early stage of the evening is only amiably drunk.  "I
will do thine errand with gladness for friendship's sake
only!"  Having duly received and pouched the coin, he adds: "Now
tell thy business to me."
</p>

<p>
"Briefly, it was but to ask thy <i>Yuzbashi</i> to accord me the
watchword, the Emir Fadl Anga having cause to pass the
gates to-night.  In thine ear, O friend!  he hath a pigeon to
fly at dawn for Mecca, and he is minded to loose the bird
from the Mount."
</p>

<p>
The <i>bash-châwush</i> nods and disappears into the tent, whence,
sung in a high nasal tenor voice to lute-accompaniment, issue
the unblushing erotics of an Arab love-song.  The Shaykh
turns to one of the <i>postas</i> lounging near the guard-tent, and
smilingly offers him a handful of thick Arab cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
"Dost thou use the Consoler? ... Take, then!"
</p>

<p>
"May Allah make it 'take' upon thee, O generous hearted
one! ..."
</p>

<p>
As the handful changes owners, and other soldiers look
out of the corners of their eyes and sidle nearer, the Shaykh
plunges both hands into deep pockets beneath his mantle, and
draws them forth generously filled with the thick, strong
cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
Upon the return of the <i>bash-châwush</i> with the information&mdash;willingly
placed at the service of the Emir&mdash;that the pass-word
of the night is "Baal Zebub," he, too, accepts a handful
of the cigarettes that are so heavily drugged with opium.  And
then the Shaykh Gôhar, with ceremonious farewells, stalks
away from the Wired Enclosure, knowing his work begun.

<h3>
XII
</h3>

<p>
Since the departure of the Shaykh Sadân, the man who
sank fainting to the floor of the wooden hut has moved once
only.  It was when he revived, dragged himself to his knees,
and while his strength sufficed&mdash;lifting his clasped hands
above his head&mdash;sent forth his soul in prayer....  Exhausted
then, he collapsed once more, and dropped forwards,
falling with outflung arms across the palm-wood bed-frame,
and for how long he does not know, was lost in unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
When sight and hearing return to him, thick darkness
presses on his burning eyeballs, and the "Lights Out" of the
Turkish <i>boruzan</i> is ringing in his ears.  Half kneeling by the
<i>anghareb</i>, half lying across it, his face is turned towards the
east wall of the hut.  Through a biggish knot-hole in the
planks, he has found it possible to see&mdash;given sufficient light
outside&mdash;beyond the barbed wire fence a circumscribed patch
of the south-going road, the tumbled hills in the distance and
the dome of the Tomb of Joseph in the foreground....  These
intermittently blotted out by the figure of the Turkish sentry,
passing to the end of his beat at the south angle of the
Enclosure, or passing back to the angle at the junction of the
road that leads to the town's east gate, with the
Jerusalem-Shechem Road.
</p>

<p>
Even in darkness, the edges of the knot-hole are outlined by
a fitful glimmer.  The flash of an electric torch, the twinkle
of a firefly, the ray of a shooting-star&mdash;there are many in
this month of November&mdash;find their way through the
knot-hole in the wall.
</p>

<p>
But the knot-hole is no longer there.  They have stopped
it up from outside! he thinks, and a groan breaks from him.
He has borne so much that this little thing&mdash;fresh evidence
of studied malice on the part of his jailers&mdash;hurts, like the
brutal tearing of a bandage from a stiffened wound....  He
shudders, hearing a curious, scratching, rasping sound,
mingled with low whispering:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sidi, Sidi! ... Sidi, Sidi!</i>"
</p>

<p>
His blood freezes in his veins.  What is that strange, soft
voice, and where does it come from?  Can this be another
essay on the part of the Shaykh Sadân?  He waits for the
next move&mdash;setting his teeth, steeling his soul with faith in
his Master.  Now, now, the whispering comes again:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sidi, Sidi!</i>  Do you hear me?  O <i>Sidi</i>, are you there? ..."
</p>

<p>
It is the thin, rustling voice of the little Mother of
Ugliness.  He utters a stifled cry of joy, and dragging his chain
with him, rolls off the <i>anghareb</i>, and in his weakness, sinks
down close to the hut's east wall.  Passing his thin hands over
the wall in the darkness, he encounters a projection.  The end
of a long rubber-covered cane, from which the whispering
comes:
</p>

<p>
"If the Sidi hears my voice, let him be pleased to answer!
It is Ummshni! ..."
</p>

<p>
"I hear," he calls back through the improvised speaking-tube.
"May God reward thee, gentle heart!  How didst thou
find me out? ..."
</p>

<p>
"How, is a long story meet for telling elsewhere.  Has the
Sidi a bowl, or other vessel?  If not let him set mouth to the
end of this," the speaker taps on the tube gently with a
fingernail, "and I will pour milk through the canes.  Tap thrice
when I am to pour! ..."
</p>

<p>
He does so, and the tube is slowly tilted, and a cautious
trickle of boiled goat's milk flows over his parched tongue.
He sucks for life, and when he has drunk:
</p>

<p>
"Rest now," says the whispering voice.  "It is ill to take
overmuch at the beginning.  Next time I will give thee broth,
and afterwards good wine.  For the Sidi must be strengthened
against the hour when for the prisoner comes Rescue.  Let
him tap thrice on the pipe if he has heard...."
</p>

<p>
He taps on the cane-lined length of rubber tubing....  The
little voice goes on:
</p>

<p>
"Listen, my lord! ... At midnight thy friends will come
to deliver thee.  So, when thou hast well taken the soup and
wine, lie down on the bed and rest....  Sleep if thou canst,
but not too sound.  When there comes a scraping in the earth
under the bedstead, rise up and move aside the <i>anghareb</i>.
My lord has clearly heard? ..."
</p>

<p>
He signifies assent, and the voice goes on whispering,
sending a reviving stream of Hope into his empty, sapless heart,
that is invigorating to his drooping spirit, as the milk to his
famished body.
</p>

<p>
"Lift up the <i>anghareb</i>, and thou wilt find a hole in the
earth under it.  Planks covered with earth hide the hole.  The
hole is the Gate of Hope for thee!&mdash;the Way that leads to
Freedom!  Does the Sidi understand?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, and thank thee from my soul! ... Who are the
friends, Ummshni?  I only have known of one beside thyself.
But no word has reached me from that man, since the War
Prisoners were shifted from camp at Beersheba to the Barracks
here at Shechem!"
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast four friends here besides myself!"
</p>

<p>
He did not know he was so rich, and a thrill of joy goes
through him.
</p>

<p>
"The chief of them is Edward Yaill.  Thou dost recall
that name?  Ay!  Then comes John Hazaël...."
</p>

<p>
That the prisoner has no knowledge of John Hazaël, his
silence seems to testify.
</p>

<p>
"It does not matter!"  The little voice is dry.  "The friends
to whom we owe the most are often strangers to us.  Now
it is time to give thee the broth!"
</p>

<p>
He sucks the life-giving stuff through the tube.  With her
womanly, maternal solicitude, she checks him after a little:
</p>

<p>
"Stay, now....  The Sidi feels his strength increased? ..."
</p>

<p>
He does, and says so gratefully.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;lest it make the Master sleep too heavily, I will
not give him the wine yet.  Now let him lie down awhile on
the bed that is in there.  I remain outside, watching.  What
says my lord?"
</p>

<p>
"The sentry....  How is it he does not see thee? ..."
</p>

<p>
Something like Ummshni's little rustling laugh comes
through the rubber-covered pipe-stems.
</p>

<p>
"Love hath no eyes, it is often said.  Since a white flower
fell on the dust in the dusk, and a light foot went past him,
is Baba Ishak, the Darweesh, blind&mdash;and dumb as well, ah-hah!
Now he is at the other end of his beat, his face set to Ebal,
and the Tombs of the Sons of Mohammed.  He is waiting
Opportunity, as a dog near the butcher's shop....  When the
butcher looks the other way&mdash;or goes into the house to speak
to his wife, the dog sneaks round the doorpost and&mdash;his head
is in the scrap-box!  Sweet,&mdash;the first greedy crunch, and
gulp....  But then comes the butcher's chopper&mdash;down on
the dog's skull!  Now lie thou down and try to sleep.  I have
said I will keep watch here! ..."
</p>

<p>
Holding his chain so that it may not clank, Father Julian
creeps back to the verminous bed, and tries to do her bidding.
But the throbbing of his anxious heart and the roaring of
the blood in his ears make sleep impossible.  The cheap
gun-metal wrist-watch that he wears has not been taken from him,
and it has been kept wound up&mdash;it is ticking companionably
now.  Four matches are left in his box.  Sheltering the flame
within the coat that serves him as a bed-covering, he strikes
a match, and looks at the watch.  It is twenty minutes past
ten o'clock, and Deliverance comes at midnight.  How wait
through the long hours, for that knocking under the floor?
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Darweesh who is <i>imâm</i> of his platoon, and can resist
all the Forbidden Things except the Cup of Beauty, stands
at the north angle of the Wired Place, looking towards the
Tombs.  In his hot thick hand is a white rose, sweet and
musky-smelling, in his nostrils a whiff of sandal and some
pungent Bazâr perfume.  The Baba is a little man, and his
inamorata a tallish woman, but she looked a strapping wench
to-night, as she passed him at the other end of his beat, with
a whispered word and a dropped flower, and a provocative
flash of her gipsy-eyes from the folds of her white <i>izar</i>.
</p>

<p>
He wheels, smacks the butt of his Mauser rifle with the
flat of his broad hand, and licks his thick lips longingly.
Turning out his sandalled toes&mdash;for the second-line troops of the
Redif stick to the old-fashioned <i>chariks</i>, with bandages wound
round the leg from the calf down&mdash;he marches towards the
sentry-box where Delilah waits for him.
</p>

<p>
There is little breeze on this muggy night of scant
starshine and blotted shadows, but a south-going waft sends a
withered leaf or a torn scrap of paper scurrying at Baba
Ishak's heels along the dusty road.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tr'rp&mdash;tr'rp&mdash;tr'rp!</i>" ...
</p>

<p>
A tiny sound, and yet it irks and fidgets.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Trrp&mdash;tr'rp ...!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Whatever it is, it scurries past, as the Darweesh halts
before the sentry-box.  Snuffing the clamorous perfume of the
Bazâr with an anticipative smile on his thick lips, he stands
on the threshold and peers into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Inaini!" he coos, amorously to the odorous obscurity.  "My
soul!  My eyes!  Thou hast come to me!  Tell me that thou
art there? ..."
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly Inaini is there, he can see her white figure
plainly against the shadowy background.  It is late in the day
for Inaini to be coy, but too early not to humour her.  He
stretches out a greedy, perspiring hand.  It touches the folds
of her <i>izar</i>.  Stung to enterprise, prodded by propinquity,
the Baba puts down his Mauser, carefully leaning it against
the side of the sentry-box, and blunders forwards.  Aha!  At
last he has her, the willing prisoner of his eager arms.
</p>

<p>
<i>Mashâllah!</i> how the gipsy hugs.  All the breath is squeezed
out of the Baba.  What is this that coils about him, binding
down his arms?  Not a rope?  <i>Chok</i>! <i>chok</i>!  He opens his
jaws to expostulate&mdash;and a gag of oiled camel-hide is deftly
slipped between them&mdash;and strapped uncomfortably tight at
the back of his bull-neck.  Swiftly his knees are bound, and
then his ankles, and he is tenderly lowered to the bottom of
the sentry-box.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The love affair of the Baba and the gipsy has ended with
dramatic swiftness.  Now the dark figure of a man steps
out of the sentry-box, picks up the Mauser and resumes the
beat of galloping hoofs coming along the Shechem road, and
gleam glints on the bandolier taken from the victim, it shows
the face of Namrûd under the khaki <i>enverieh</i>.  And caught in
some stray backwash of the sickly breeze that carried it, the
tiny thing like a withered leaf, flits down the road again.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0413"></a></p>

<h3>
XIII
</h3>

<p>
Whether John Hazel dreamed or not, things have happened
as he has seen them.  Conscious thought returns to him,
sitting on the box of bombs.  His lungs fill with a deep breath.
He yawns hugely, blinks his eyes, squares his shoulders and
looks about him.  The constellation Orion blazes over Gilead,
the Pleiades are hidden from sight by sombre clouds.  There
is a strange glare in the sky over the crest of Gerizim.
</p>

<p>
In mid-song the bulbuls have fallen silent.  Even the
pariah-dogs and the jackals are still.  There is something abroad
upon the air to-night, that weighs upon the spirit of humanity,
and daunts the creatures, soulless as we imagine, with the
sense of evil, nameless and unseen, but dominant and powerful
to harm....
</p>

<p>
And now the man who listens at his post hears the quick
beat of galloping hoofs coming along the Shechem road, and
thrills with expectation:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That's them!"  In moments of keen excitement John's
grammar is apt to fail.  "Them, for a quid!  Or the Colonel
hasn't pulled off the snatch, and has had&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He breaks off as the horsemen round a curve of the road.
Where a patch of the grudging moonlight whitens the ground,
he makes out that there are only three of them.  No!  Four&mdash;!
Three riders in ample, flowing Arab dress, and a fourth in
the close-fitting kit of a European&mdash;who reels and sways
unsteadily in his saddle, and would fall&mdash;but for the help that
another gives&mdash;with a hand that is sometimes at his back, and
sometimes at his bridle.
</p>

<p>
"By God!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
With a great exultant throb, John swings himself down
from the lorry upon the road, as the riders check the gallop
of their eager, snorting horses....  And the hot, white
limestone dust of Samaria rises in pungent clouds.
</p>

<p>
Now through the dust an immense hand finds, grips and
wrings the priest's, and a deep resonant voice, not like any he
has heard before, and yet not strange, says rapidly:
</p>

<p>
"Thanks be to the Most High, my lord is delivered!  Now,
from the servant of his house, let him take this.  It comes from
the Sister of my lord" (a crumpled envelope is thrust into
Julian Forbis's palm), "by the hand of John Hazel!"
</p>

<p>
"A letter from my sister....  Sir, may God reward you!
You must be John Hazaël, I think!  Though I never heard
that name until to-night, while I live I shall always bless it!"
</p>

<p>
The voice sends an electric shock volting through John.  It
is like the voice he loves, as a man's may resemble a woman's,
deeper, stronger, and hollow with fatigue.  He returns:
</p>

<p>
"My lord is right.  I am the man John.  Youngest and
last of all Hazaëls of the line save one only....  But all the
Hazaëls, from the first to the last, do battle for my lord this
night in Samaria.  Now let my lord ride hard for Kir Saba.
Though his enemies pursue they shall not pass here!  For,
God so willing, I, thy servant, will keep this road barred!"
</p>

<p>
"My cousin John! ..."
</p>

<p>
He hears a timid call he knows, and turning towards the
quarter whence it comes, traces it to its source in a small
rebellious bundle, held on the front of an Arab's saddle.
</p>

<p>
"O John my cousin, dost thou hear me!  Entreat the Most
Excellent One to set me on the ground!"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hazel, with your good leave, I mean to take this lady
to Kir Saba."  It is the voice that spoke to him last in the
chintz drawing-room at Kerr's Arbour.  Dimly seen in the
hazy moonlight, the eyes shaded by the silken <i>kuffiyeh</i> meet
John's, and although they are blazing with the fierce joy of
the successful raider, he recognises the eyes of Edward Yaill.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay!  I would remain here with John Hazaël," the
little creature pleads in her distress.
</p>

<p>
"Thou wilt go with my lord and be his handmaid.  When
he needs thee no longer, then return to me.  Hearest thou,
woman?" the deep voice says, and Ummshni, bowing her
veiled head, humbly answers:
</p>

<p>
"O Head of our House, I hear! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Farewell then, little Brave One!"
</p>

<p>
In the dark John reaches out, and pats her small cold hand.
</p>

<p>
"Not in this world, nor in the next will this that thou hast
lone go unrewarded.  What is that? ... Cavalry on the
road!"  His hearing, in this strange exalted mood of his,
being even keener than Namrûd the Hunter's,&mdash;has warned
him that a body of mounted men, coming from the direction of
Shechem, are pushing along the road.  He relapses into his
ordinary, natural tone, as he says with a slap of his heavy
hand on the flank of Fadl Anga's thoroughbred: "Ride for
Kir Saba, Colonel Yaill, and all good luck to you!"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Mr. Hazel, and good-bye.  Though I would prefer
your coming with us.  You could take Namrûd's horse&mdash;and
he and I would ride and run by turns.  Not the first time
we've covered distance that way!"
</p>

<p>
There is an unalterable decision in the answer:
</p>

<p>
"Much obliged, Colonel, but I've arranged to stay."
</p>

<p>
"Good luck, then, and good-bye.  You will shake hands at
parting? ..."
</p>

<p>
The huge hand of the big Jew, and Yaill's leaner, slenderer,
smaller hand, meet and grip hard, then John steps backwards.
</p>

<p>
"Ride like old hell, the lot of you.  I stop&mdash;to carry on!"
</p>

<p>
A clatter of hoofs and they are away, in a cloud of the
dust of Samaria, flavoured with the chamomile and wormwood
of the desert, the acrid sweat of man and horse,
tobacco, attar of roses, and leather tanned by Bedwân with
bitter laurel-bark.  John Hazel looks about him, fills his lungs
with deep breaths and calculates his powers.  How if one man
were able to move the lorry across the road!
</p>

<p>
He frees himself from his Arab head-cloth and mantle,
ties the ends of the long sleeves of his <i>kumbas</i> together, slips
the knot Fellah-wise over his head, and pulls up the camel-hair
shirt to mid-thigh.  Even as the lean, tanned Prophet
girded himself for the long race from Carmel up to Samaria,
before the King in his ivory chariot&mdash;and the rainstorm
hurtling on the heels of the King....
</p>

<p>
Now he swings himself to the driver's seat, manipulates
the steering wheel, and lifts the starting-lever.  Now he gets
down, spins the crank, and heaves at the near fore-wheel.  The
lorry shakes, the ponderous armoured wheel moves&mdash;and the
sweat pours off John Hazel.  He sets his teeth, and braces
himself again, using the sound, uninjured leg as fulcrum of
the lever.  With a sound like the dumping of a load of ancient
iron on the scrap-heap&mdash;the Turkish ammunition-lorry moves
across the road....
</p>

<p>
Just in time, for the clink of cavalry chain-bridles and
scabbards, and the clatter of hoofs come nearer with every
instant....  John fills the breast of his Arab shirt with
bombs, and stands up on the lorry, in the straddling but
purposeful attitude attributed to the Colossus of Rhodes.
</p>

<p>
"Old Harris and the chaps of my platoon used to call me
a dirty fighter," he thinks, reverting to the vernacular of his
adoptive land.  "Well, this is going to be the dirtiest fight I
ever put up.  O all you old Hazaël men, back to the very
oldest, help me to keep the road that leads to Kir Saba, for
to-night! ..."
</p>

<p>
Rattle and clink.  The creak and wheeze of straining leather.
Half a squadron of Turkish Mounted Police spur round the
bend in the road.
</p>

<p>
Well armed, well mounted, big and bearded Turks, the pick
of the Bey's squadrons of mounted gendarmerie.  The darkness
hides the crimson fez and the smart Hussar uniform of
dark blue with red and orange braiding.  But what light there
is is caught and given back by long shiny jack-boots&mdash;and the
barrels of Winchester repeating-rifles&mdash;and eyes that glitter in
swarthy faces that are ablaze with the hope of a reward.
</p>

<p>
Crash! ...
</p>

<p>
A bomb falls in the middle of the road in front of the
squadron-leader, and explodes with a shattering detonation
that calls loud echoes from the hills.  The squadron-leader's
jaw is torn away.  He and his horse go down, the poor brute
screaming in a pool of his own innocent blood and vainly
struggling to rise upon his shattered forelegs....  Two of
the other riders are wounded by flying splinters.
Crash!&mdash;another bomb falls and detonates in the road....
</p>

<p>
"A Forbis!  A Forbis!  May Forbis foes fall!  A Forbis!
A Forbis! ..."
</p>

<p>
With this strange foreign slogan the Hills of Samaria ring,
and a volley from the Winchesters of the Bey's men rattles
back in answer.  Bullets flatten on the rocks&mdash;pass through
the sides of the lorry, shiver the lamps, rip the front hood,
and dent the engine-bonnet.  A second Winchester-volley
clatters amongst the rocks&mdash;when a bomb, hurled by a phenomenally
long arm, falls in the midst of the squadron.  And the
Bey's Mounted Policemen scatter and retreat in confusion,
leaving dead men and horses behind them on the road....
</p>

<p>
John draws breath.  A revolver cracks behind him&mdash;a
bullet sings past his right cheek&mdash;and another, whistling
through his hair, burns as it scores a furrow in the scalp at the
top of his head....
</p>

<p>
"Bloody close!  And fired from behind!"
</p>

<p>
He looks round, and is shot at from the original quarter
to intimate that the retreat was only a feint.  The baffled force
of gendarmerie&mdash;trained scouts for the most part&mdash;mountaineers
and hunters, has split into two parties; the hardier spirits&mdash;as
the breaking of branches and the fluttering of birds scared
from the coverts testifies&mdash;are scrambling down the steep face
of the defile, from the northern side of the road.
</p>

<p>
Again a revolver-shot cracks out behind John.  He slews his
head and catches a glimpse of the man who fired, crouching
behind a boulder, on the Jaffa side of the lorry.
</p>

<p>
<i>Crash! crash!</i> ...
</p>

<p>
Two bombs greet the renewal of the attack upon the
Shechem side....  Three, hurled one after the other with
dazzling rapidity, explode in the covert that clothes the
cliff-face.  Another hits the boulder by the road, and lessens its
proportions.  But the sharp brain behind it has foreseen that
it would come.
</p>

<p>
Lying on his stomach, the Bey's man crawls to the opposite
side of the highway.  Crouching in the shadows, he waits
unseen.  The scene is handsomely illuminated now by
bonfires among the brushwood.  Bombs explode east and west,
the arms of the giant on the lorry whirl like the sails of a
windmill.  It is at this juncture that John begins to sing....
</p>

<p>
Never did light of moon and stars shine on a grimmer
spectacle.  Foul with grime, whitened with dust, smeared and
raddled with blood from his scalp-wound, the leaping fires
on either hand show him black as a fiend from hell.  The
Bey's gendarme is a plucky child of Islam, but he shudders.
What if no human, killable man, but one of the demon Sons of
Iblis be he who is capering and dealing Death on the
Jaffa-Shechem road to-night?  Streaming with sweat, stricken with
deadly fear, he gasps:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mashallah</i>!  I invoke the Protection of the Most High
against Satan the Stoned! ..."
</p>

<p>
And springing up, sets a foot on the wheel, and leaps into
the lorry.  Next moment, locked in a wrestling-hug, two black
shapes strive together, while the <i>zabtiehs</i> hold their fire for
fear of hitting their own man.
</p>

<p>
The struggle is over in less than half a minute.  The Turk
is strong, but in those great and ruthless hands, he is dealt
with easily.  His foot slips in his opponent's blood, for the
giant is bleeding freely from chips in various places.  He yells
as he is bent back....  Then his spurred feet are lifted.  He
is tossed out of the lorry, landing on his head&mdash;and as John
continues bomb-throwing&mdash;loses temporarily, all interest in
the fight....
</p>

<p>
Now comes from the Shechem side, a charge of mounted
<i>zabtiehs</i>.  John sings as he pulls pins,&mdash;pitches and proves the
impotence of flesh and blood, human and equine, pitted against
H.E.  The police are shooting freely but wildly from behind
and before him.  Right and left he gives them the last sigh
of No. 1 box&mdash;and is diving into the other&mdash;to rise up armed,
when a bomb, that has fallen in the roadway without the
customary explosion&mdash;is picked up by a plucky <i>zabtieh</i> and hurled
back into the lorry....
</p>

<p>
John realises as the projectile falls amongst the boxed
explosives that the fight is over.  He leaps from the lorry on
the Jaffa side, and knows no more.  Miles away southward,
as the huge detonation shakes the hills, and avalanches of
<i>débris</i> tumble from the cliffs, a Gunner Officer of a Field
Battery of the 52nd Division, holding the mud village of
Mughar, says to his colleague indifferently, shutting his
night-glasses:
</p>

<p>
"The Huns are having the time of their lives to-night in
Samaria.  Regular posh firework-display to-night on the
Shechem-Jaffa road.  Now they've exploded an ammunition-dump,
or something uncommonly like it!  Hope it's wiped out a
few more Turks!&mdash;there are plenty of 'em to spare!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

XIV
</h3>

<p>
For Katharine Forbis those two days of suspense, so fraught
with fate for the two she held dearest, were ordeals of
anguish only made bearable by the work that filled the
daylight hours and the sleep, begotten of the work&mdash;that came
to her at night.  On the morning following the bomb-fight on
the Shechem-Jaffa Road, the Base was ringing with the
seizure of Junction Station; the sensational escape of Von
Kressenstein's train, and the taking, by cavalry charges from
the north, of the strong place of Mughar&mdash;a mud village on
a hill, converted into a veritable wasp's nest by Turkish
mountain-howitzers, Turkish machine gunners and Turkish riflemen.
</p>

<p>
The temper of the enemy stiffened.  Resistance still was
stubborn&mdash;difficulties of transport still held up the Expeditionary
Army in full sight of the Jerusalem-Shechem Road.  Yet
it was the Day of the White Arm....  Three Captains'
Crusaders of the Bucks Hussars and Dorset Yeomanry led the
dazzling charges that cleared the way for the 52nd Division,
and made of Mughar "not a sweet place to look at," as an
English War Correspondent put it pithily&mdash;for many Turkish
heads being cleft in twain after the approved mediæval method&mdash;the
place wanted a lot of cleaning up.  One of the glorious
Three&mdash;son of a great English Statesman, himself an Under
Secretary for Foreign Affairs and one of the Chief Whips
of the 1915 Ministry&mdash;was shot barely twelve hours after the
victory.  And before sunset on this day, a distinguished Jew;
financier, soldier, sportsman, philanthropist&mdash;met death almost
within sight of the Colonies founded by his family on the
Plains of Sharon, and south of Jaffa the Beautiful....
</p>

<p>
On this same date Maurice Hazel, piloting a Handley-Page
bomber on a raid over the Hindenburg Line, was killed by a
hit from German shrapnel....  And Lady Wastwood, reading
the War News in the late edition of the <i>Alexandrian
Courier</i> and crying over men who had been ancient flames,
and boys who had been her dead boy's School-chums&mdash;came
on this undistinguished item among the casualties, and
recognised the name.
</p>

<p>
"'Maurice Benn Hazel' ...  Kathy's huge Jew friend
mentioned having a brother Maurice in the R.F.C.  As I
really want an excuse for a word with Kathy, I'll look her up
and mention the thing.  Though it seems rather like making
use of the poor dear boy!  How callous we're all getting.  But
I suppose we have to be, to carry on at all!"
</p>

<p>
With which conclusion, the day's work being over, Trixie
removed the traces of emotion with powder, and betook
herself in search of Katharine.
</p>

<p>
She found Miss Forbis in the rose-garden pavilion, reading
letters from England that had come by the afternoon's mail.
Time had not served until now to open them, and the first
envelope had contained a type-written enclosure within, a
communication from Sir Arthur Ely, appended here below:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
  HOLBORN COURT,<br>
  <i>November</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1917.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR MISS FORBIS,
</p>

<p>
Knowing you to be working with the Red Cross at Montana
Convalescent Hospital near Alexandria, and in the hope
that Colonel Yaill&mdash;from whom I have not heard since he
left England last February, may have communicated to you
his present address&mdash;I have thought it best to send you the
enclosed copy of a letter recently delivered at his Club, and
opened by me as his solicitor&mdash;having authority from him, in
his absence, to deal with his correspondence, and administer
his business affairs.  I am sufficiently old a friend of his and
yours also, to add my heartiest congratulations to you both.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "Very sincerely yours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ARTHUR CAMERON ELY."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Here is the enclosure:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
  "PARK AUXILIARY MILITARY HOSPITAL,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"HOODING,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"SUSSEX.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>November</i> 2, 1917
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAR SIR:
</p>

<p>
"A friend of mine who you met under the name of Nurse
Lucy Burtonshaw at the Convalescent Officers Camp, B&mdash;&mdash;
Base in November 1915 has asked me to write you her hands
being full at present and feeling herself unequal to the task.
</p>

<p>
"The fact is that while finishing her three years service
as a Probationer at the County General Hospital Leam Somerset
in 1913 she was married on the strict Q.T. at the Registrar's
Office Leam to Private J. Didlick of the 5th Lancers
a young man known from childhood and objected to by Lucy's
parents on the grounds of his being the son of the local baker
and too much given to drink.  In August 1914 Private Didlick
went to the Front with the First Expeditionary Army and his
name duly appeared upon the list of Killed after the Battle
of Mons.  Nurse Burtonshaw regrets that she omitted to
mention this at the time of your marriage her hands being
so full just then.
</p>

<p>
"I will not detain you further except by saying that in
April last on the eve of the Battle of Arras Private now
Lance-Corporal Didlick with several other British prisoners
escaped from the zone of fire where they had been kept by
the Germans at forced work and very badly used Corporal
Didlick particularly being covered with boils and weighing
only 8st. 31bs. when drafted Home and later on sent to this
Hospital I could hardly recognise him.  Later I communicated
with his wife and advised her to break the news to you her
proper place undoubtedly being by her poor husband's side.
Her hands being full she has put off writing up to the present.
Now at her request us being old friends I have taken up the
pen.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Didlick earnestly hopes you will regard bygones as
bygones and requests me herewith to enclose your cheque
received for her last quarter's allowance regularly forwarded
since February by your Solicitor, Sir Arthur Ely to whose
care this communication is addressed.  In case of loss in the
post things being so uncertain in War Time I have sent
another letter similarly worded care of Miss Forbis, Kerr's
Arbour, Nr Cauldstanes Tweedshire, N.B.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "I remain, Dear Sir,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Truly yours<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"DOROTHY PIDGE,<br>
  "<i>Certified Nurse &mdash;&mdash;th Nursing Unit R.R.C.</i>"<br>
</p>

<p>
"P.S.  Excuse the liberty but I do hope you won't be hard
on Lucy!  She means well but hasn't a particle of moral
backbone."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
If Katharine perused this queer letter with mingled sensations,
amazed joy and unutterable relief ruled predominant
above all.
</p>

<p>
For it was over, the haunting day and nightmare of
loss and separation.  Her bosom rose upon a long breath of
relief, as the burden passed away.  The barrier dividing
Katharine from all she held dearest, had vanished at the
wholesome touch of loyal Nurse Dorothy Pidge.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God! and thank you&mdash;you honest-hearted woman!
Now to tell Edward&mdash;if I knew where to reach him!" was
her thought.  And the claws of suspense fastened in her soul
anew, and that moment's joyful lightening of her heart made
the weight that burdened it even more intolerable to bear.
</p>

<p>
Not the cool sea-breeze that stole through the fretted sides
of the Khedive's marble pavilion, the beloved haunt of her
leisure, nor the fragrance of the November-blooming roses
that climbed its walls, and wreathed the balustrade of its
terrace with trails of pink and orange, cream and white and
crimson; not the nightingales that sang in the moss-cup oaks,
nor the orioles that built amongst the vine-trellises&mdash;where the
fireflies would twinkle and gleam at dusk when the nightingales
sang their sweetest&mdash;could bring soothing to her tortured
mind, or rest to her overwrought nerves.
</p>

<p>
"I can't&mdash;stand&mdash;much more!" she said slowly, speaking
aloud of purpose, for the sheer relief of speech.  "We have
all got a point beyond which we break, and this is my
breaking-point.  Oh! for some news of those three men of mine!"
</p>

<p>
Edward Yaill, Julian and John Hazel....  She saw them
individually, each reduced to the size of a gnat, at the end of a
long vista, striving, and striving desperately, yet unable to
meet and touch.  She saw them in the midst of a cloud of
other human gnats, buzzing and stinging....  She saw them
borne down by numbers&mdash;she saw them emerge triumphant.
She saw&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Darling Kathy, do unclench your hands and iron out your
forehead," said the welcome voice of Trixie at this juncture:
"Even a woman with your appearance cannot afford to go on,
looking like Lady Macbeth, Clytemnestra and Antigone,
rolled into one, for long!"
</p>

<p>
"Did I ... Do I?" Katharine asked absently....
</p>

<p>
"You both did and do," Trixie returned.  She came and
sat on the balcony near Katharine and touched her lightly
on the shoulder with a long, thin but sympathetic hand.  "You're
rather a terrifying person when you look like this, but I have
a reason for being venturesome.  May I broach a subject I've
avoided for ages?  I need hardly explain, I fancy, that the
subject is Edward Yaill?"
</p>

<p>
Such burning colour flooded the face now turned to hers,
that Trixie experienced relief from forebodings that had
haunted her.  The colossal coffee-coloured Jew with the coarse
black hair, Cockney accent and huge nose was nothing to
Kathy!  She always had had that wonderful look when you
mentioned Edward Yaill.  She was unchanged...  It upset
you to imagine that women like Kathy altered.  It did you
good to find out that she stuck to the old love....
</p>

<p>
The subject broached, Trixie told her tale.  Faithful to
the motto of the Liberal Ladies War Service League, "Do
Anything, Go Anywhere, Stick at Nothing and Never
Grouse!" she had, pending her return to active usefulness,
been "rummaging out" cases in the General Hospitals who
wanted extra visiting, letter-writing and bucking.  And at
No. 11 she had come across a Nice Man, newly convalescent
from a collection of intestinal symptoms prevalent among the
Expeditionary Forces,&mdash;assembled by the C.M.O. under the
heading "Bilharziosis," and simplified to "Bill Harris," in the
mouths of sufferers therefrom....
</p>

<p>
"A Sergeant of the 'Tweedburgh Regiment' transferred&mdash;  Don't
ask me how! to a Lowland Territorial Battalion, and
perfectly devoted to Colonel Yaill.  Nearly cried when he
talked of him.  Desperately keen to get a letter written and
smuggled Home&mdash;for of course the Censor wouldn't dream of
passing it!&mdash;to Yaill's sisters at his place in Cumberland, and
another to Miss Forbis, 'her that the Colonel ought to have
been married on&mdash;saying the Colonel is alive and serving with
the Secret Intelligence Corps in the Front in Palestine.'"
</p>

<p>
"Dear Lady Wastwood&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My child, don't put me off with interruptions!  Of course
I explained to my poor sick man that the letter couldn't be
properly engineered, and might do Colonel Yaill harm if the
contents got out.  But I told him you were out here, and
should have his information.  The man swears Edward to be
an intrepid Scout, famous for making his way through the
Turkish Lines, on foot or mounted on a swift horse, sometimes
alone!&mdash;sometimes with two companions....  He has been
seen in Cairo dressed as a French Staff Officer&mdash;we know he
speaks the language perfectly!&mdash;and in Constantinople as a
Greek Interpreter to one of the Embassies.  And here in Alex,
he has gone about disguised as an Arab&mdash;or a Gippy of the
Labour Corps&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know it, dear Lady Wastwood, I was almost sure of it
before!&mdash;I have been certain since John Hazel came back
from the Front four days ago, to tell me&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Trixie's green eyes enlarged under their arched black
eyebrows, that so much resembled musical slurs.
</p>

<p>
"Of course!  I might have known.  Do go on, like a Precious
Person!  If a sieve about my own affairs, I'm a tomb
for the secrets of others!"
</p>

<p>
So Katharine, knowing this to be true, told Trixie the reason
of her anxiety.  Characteristically the long thin finger pointed
to the doubtful spot:
</p>

<p>
"It's thrilling in the extreme.  No wonder you're in tatters
with anxiety.  But I can't help seeing that it's rather fatal to
have two different people plotting to save one man.  Almost
like a brace of dentists tugging at a single tooth, isn't it?  Why
couldn't they have Joined forces and worked it as a Syndicate?
That's what your John Hazel will try for, I feel it in my bones.
One thing I must say!  I do wish the Basilisk hadn't anything
to do with it!  That oily-tongued little Egyptian Flying Pasha
gives me the creeps!  But the main thing just now is to buck
up, and believe that everything will come off rippingly.  And
I have a feeling in my bones it will!"
</p>

<p>
"And if it doesn't&mdash;if the news is the worst that can be
told, I hope that I shall be brave enough to bear it!" said
Katharine.  "I hope that I shall never swerve from the belief
that Love&mdash;as it exists between clean-souled men and women&mdash;isn't
only for this world!  And that the pain of frustrated
earthly passion may be so mingled with the Faith that looks
forward,&mdash;forward and Heavenward!&mdash;that parting for this
little life may be robbed of its bitterest sting!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear, I can't climb up to your level," said Trixie,
blinking her green eyes and pursing her V-shaped, Pierrot
mouth.  "This world&mdash;when my husband and boys were in
it&mdash;was good enough, I'm ashamed to say!  And if they were
back, I'm not going to pretend I should bother much about
Heaven, and I do hope you've too much sense to believe that
I should!  But this business of yours will be pulled off all
right.  I feel it in my bones, and they never deceive me.  Your
brother Julian and your friend the Jew, and poor Edward
Yaill&mdash;whom I treated so frightfully out of pure championship for
you when he fell over my feet into the Express for Carlisle&mdash;that
he fell out again!&mdash;All three will get safe out of the place
with the name that reminds me of Sunday School examinations.
And you and I will be standing here, like the heroine
and her bosom-friend in the scene that comes just before the
return of the hero in what American people call a
four-mile-reel-scream, when a letter or a wire will bring the glad news.
And you will read out the letter to me as they say the film
people do it, keeping your features intelligently in play, and
saying anything that comes into your head.  Like this: 'Pepper,
mustard, Cerebos, olive-oil and salad dressing!  Piccalilli and
catsup.  O, Harrods! ... After all these months of beastly
eating&mdash;tinned brawn for lunch again!'"
</p>

<p>
Trixie's well-meant nonsense served its end, for Katharine
could resist no more and burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"You dear!"  Miss Forbis's laughing eyes were soft as she
passed an arm round the long narrow waist and warmly
kissed the thin white cheek.  She added, as Trixie returned
the caress: "You're priceless to me, Commandant!  When
I feel down, or get the blues&mdash;with reason or without
them&mdash;you're a better pick-me-up than all the Worcester sauce in
the world."
</p>

<p>
"Horrible stuff!" Trixie made a grimace, "I've always
loathed it.  Once I had a dear old friend who drank herself
to death on that.  Her husband&mdash;lucky man! never suspected
until she died&mdash;and they found the chimney in her dressing-room
simply blocked with empty shilling bottles.  Who's
that?  <i>Di ê di</i>?  Have you a message there? ..."
</p>

<p>
A cautious footstep on the gravel path, badly neglected since
the War, and overgrown with patches of rafia, had first
reached Lady Wastwood's ears.  Now a man&mdash;recognised by
Katharine and her friend as the dapper French-speaking
Italian chauffeur who had driven them from Alexandria three
days previously, in the Daimler car belonging to Essenian,
stepped from the trellised shade of a path into the light of the
rose-wreathed doorway, and saluting the ladies without speaking,
held out a letter to Katharine.
</p>

<p>
News....
</p>

<p>
Something in Katharine's bosom leaped....  She felt
stifled, as though the fretted, sun-flecked walls of the Khedive's
rose-pavilion were those of a brick-built prison, impervious to
light and air.  But with an effort she mastered herself, and
took the offered letter&mdash;hoping the Italian did not note the
trembling of her hand.
</p>

<p>
It was a square heliotrope envelope, violently scented with
some clinging Eastern perfume that revolted Katharine.  The
address to "Miss Forbis, Convalescent Hospital, The Palace,
Montana," was typed in vivid violet ink.  Unwilling to open
the letter in the presence of a stranger, Katharine hesitated,
looking at the Italian:
</p>

<p>
"Is there any reply to this? ..."
</p>

<p>
Lady Wastwood had spoken.  The Italian answered in his
nasal French, looking at Katharine:
</p>

<p>
"The car is waiting....  If Mademoiselle would read!"
</p>

<p>
Katharine, conscious of the unsteadiness of her hands,
opened the type-addressed envelope.  The sheet of paper it
contained bore this message:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Come at once.  Urgent!  J. H."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The four-word message and the initials beneath were typed
in violet ink.  Underneath was an impression in coarse green
sealing-wax of the onyx signet-ring....
</p>

<p>
Katharine was silent, mastering her deep excitement.  That
green seal seemed to burn through her eyes and sear her brain
as she stared at it.  Again she heard John Hazel saying:
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I were ever to send a line saying '<i>Come at
once!</i>' ... Well, don't come!&mdash;unless the paper bears an impression
of this, in sealing-wax, or clay, or bread or mud....  And test
it by the ring you wear, before you accept it...."
</p>

<p>
The test could be made at once.  She glanced at the signet
on her left hand and then at the Italian chauffeur.  His round,
black eyes were fixed on her, watching her eagerly.  She
spoke to the man in quiet, level tones:
</p>

<p>
"I will come in a few minutes.  Be good enough to wait
for me...."
</p>

<p>
"As Mademoiselle desires."  The Italian's bird-bright eyes
snapped excitedly.  "I will go back and wait for her.  But&mdash;"
he shrugged and spread his olive hands, "we have a long way
to go.  Mademoiselle understands that, naturally...."
</p>

<p>
"I understand, and I will come in five minutes," Katharine
said, with her tone of calm authority.
</p>

<p>
"My dear&mdash;" Lady Wastwood asked anxiously, as the
Italian saluted, wheeled and went out of the pavilion: "You've
had news!&mdash;I see it in your face."
</p>

<p>
"No news!" Katharine said.  "But a summons, most
certainly."  Days previously, she had taken a careful impression
in scarlet sealing-wax of the relievo head of Hercules upon
her black onyx signet.  Now she took from her cigarette-case
the card bearing the impression, and laying the letter
on the marble table the pavilion contained, placed the card
face downwards over the green seal on the heliotrope paper.
The surfaces of paper and card met and wedded, as the green
relievo sank into the scarlet intaglio, and the two Hercules'
heads became one.
</p>

<p>
"I'm fearfully impressed."  Trixie's eyes were circular with
interest and curiosity.  "But what on earth is that for? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Just to make sure," Katharine said, turning away, "that
the message that says, '<i>Come At Once.  Urgent!</i>' is really from
John Hazel.  Now I must go.  I've a suit-case ready packed
in our sleeping-tent, and the Commandant has been prepared
against my being called suddenly away.  As for the duty,
Molly Lyne-Soames carries on instead of me.  She's prepared&mdash;a
regular brick of a girl!&mdash;and so&mdash;this until you next hear
from me!"  She caught the astonished Trixie in a warm
embrace, kissed her thin cheeks and left a tear on one of them.
"God bless you, you kindest of women!" she called, turning
on the threshold of the rose-pavilion to wave her hand.  "And
so good-bye, until we meet again!"
</p>

<p>
And flushed and radiant, Katharine was gone, taking with
her in her haste a trail of a thorny climbing rose that had
clung to her as though to keep her, and leaving its crimson
petals scattered on the stone.  As her light hurried footsteps
died away&mdash;a little puff of the westerly breeze swept the card
and the heliotrope letter, with their green and red seals, off
the marble table to the floor&mdash;and hurried them into a corner
as though their work were done.

<p>
Near where Ismailia sits amidst her flowery gardens and
tasselled avenues, on the edge of the scorching Desert of el
Jifar, is an arid rectangle of sand east of the Canal, above
Lake Timsah, used at the time I write of as an Air Base.
Beyond Essenian, there were no native officers serving at the
Air Base, though the indomitable Gyppos of the Labour Corps
were employed at the aërodrome in building hangars, and
cleaning the machines.  Here rows of 'buses, both B.C.'s and
D.H.6's&mdash;used for reconnaissance on the Canal, along the
shores of the Red Sea as far as Aden&mdash;and over the Front in
Palestine&mdash;were ranged in readiness in front of their great
hangars, and observers in double-breasted tunics of drill or
serge, with shorts and forage-caps&mdash;or yet more simply and
economically attired in flannel shirts, canvas shoes and
sun-helmets&mdash;stood on the summits of wooden towers, combing
the blue with high-powered binoculars for enemy aircraft, in
watches, relieved at three-hour intervals....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Not without reason had the Pasha boasted of the beauty of
his villa, a white marble palace of Arabian-Turkish
architecture, standing well back from an avenue of casuarinas,
embowered in trailing roses, clothed with imperial Bougainvillea
and shaded with trees, rising from the green velvet lawns
that carpet what was a rectangle of barrenness wrested from
the Desert twenty-three years ago.
</p>

<p>
Within the palace, suites of rooms&mdash;used in the Oriental
style as reception saloons or bedrooms&mdash;according to the needs
of the moment&mdash;were furnished in luxury rivalling the most
modern of Parisian hotels.  Soft-footed, low-voiced servants,
chiefly Mohammedans, dressed in speckless white, and moving
like automata, waited upon the master's guests and did the
master's will.
</p>

<p>
Here Nasr Ullah, the Pasha's elderly body-servant and
confidential messenger, ruled with rigidity, taking it out of his
subordinates when the Presence dealt hardly with him.  In two
rooms of the vast warren of rooms opening on a rearward
court, his "house" and a small brood of sturdy boys were
accommodated.  A little dark Moslemah the wife of Nasr Ullah,
well dressed and laden with solid silver jewellery.  Plain, with
projecting rabbit teeth, and shallow forehead; meek, dutiful,
pious and greatly given to prayer.  A grave for the secrets of
her husband Nasr, who was occasionally burdened with a
conscience, whose smarting called for soothing feminine balms.
</p>

<p>
He stood on the threshold of his outer room, in the mild,
pale hour when the stars were flowering through the last glow
of the sunset, and his tall white turban was pushed awry, and
his high forehead was ridged with care.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a tyranny to force a man of kindly heart towards
God's creatures, to scatter poisoned barley for the birds," he
said uneasily.  "And the carrier-dove is the Bird of Nun,
that went forth from the Ark and brought back the olive-leaf,
and a dove was the bird that the Son of Mariam&mdash;when as
yet but a babe of tender years&mdash;playing with others who knew
not His holiness&mdash;wrought by the riverside of clay."
</p>

<p>
"And the boys laughed and mocked Him, because He had
made one bird instead of many.  And He was not angry, but
said, 'Do ye then as I do!'  And then He clapped His hands
and the dove flew away.  Did it not so, O my father?" a
thready voice piped.
</p>

<p>
"Since when," asked Nasr Ullah with affected sternness,
"have the babes permission to lift up voice when their elders
take counsel?"  His lined face softened into tenderness as the
child clinging to the mother's skirts hid his head under her
veil.  "Remember, O woman!" he went on, "I have said the
white powder is a deadly poison.  If a speck, such as would
lie safely hidden under the finger-nail&mdash;find a way into the
child's milk-bowl, I were without a son."
</p>

<p>
"It is all in there....  I boiled the barley until soft, and
drained the water away carefully&mdash;emptied the paper-packet
of powder in among the barley and stirred the barley well
with a little stick.  Then I burned both the paper and the
stick, as thou didst order.  Remains for thee to break the pot
to sherds when&mdash;when thou hast finished.  O my misfortune!
What a task!  My lord, Nasr Ullah, who hath the pride of
princes!&mdash;to creep about under cover of night&mdash;from the
courtyard of the Commandant-Sahib to the <i>haush</i> where the
<i>Ifrangis</i> keep their swallow-boats, scattering poisoned barley
for pigeons with messages&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hûs! ..."
</p>

<p>
She had raised her usually quiet voice somewhat indiscreetly,
and the toddler, youngest save one of Fatimeh's brood of
four, scared by the unusualness of this demonstration, lifted
up his own voice in a lusty howl.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hus&mdash;sus!</i>  No one is vexed with thee, my joy!&mdash;nobody
is angry!  Run out and play with the little grey goat awhile
before thy sleep-time comes!"  And as the boy with a shrill
joyful chuckle toddled over the threshold to seek his
playmate, Nasr Ullah promptly clapped the door to and shot the
wooden door-bolt, and not content with this, pulled the heavy
leather curtains that kept out chilly winds and June and
February <i>samûms</i>, over the doorway and the latticed
window-screens.
</p>

<p>
"By the life of the Prophet&mdash;peace on him!&mdash;by thy head! speak
lower.  What Afrit hast thou vexed&mdash;throwing away
the carrot-tops and the water that washed the dishes?" he
demanded of his now hysterically-tearful wife.  "Is this my
house, whom I deemed discreet as Kadijah&mdash;peace be upon
her!  Raising the voice like a woman accustomed to go
unveiled?  Trumpeting secrets as it were on the very housetops!
Wouldst be a widow?  'Nay?'  Then shun the road to mourning!
Wouldst die thyself, knowing thy four sons cast out&mdash;to
whine for <i>faddahs</i> and broken bread at the doors of the
khans and mosques....  'Nay' again? ... Then even hold
thy tongue.  And, Fatimeh my beloved&mdash;"  Nasr Ullah's lean,
dark, muscular hand caressed the woman's small head, adorned
with a smart black silk kerchief with a brightly coloured
border, and a forehead-string of coins&mdash;all gold ones, though
their value was but small,&mdash;"vex not thy soul overmuch about
the doves and pigeons.  Are not their numbers countless as the
numbers of the flies?  And tell me, my olive-tree, fruitful in
bearing&mdash;my Garment of Comfort," his tone had become
wheedling, "whether any of the veiled women serving about
this house be one-eyed?  <i>Wallah</i>!  I jest not!  It is a new
order of the Presence that all such are to be dismissed!"
</p>

<p>
"How soon?"  Another tempest seemed about to shake Nasr
Ullah's fruitful olive.  Her bosom under its many serried
rows of solid silver necklaces began to heave again.  Her heavy
anklets clashed as her small, henna-stained feet shifted
nervously on the whitened clay floor of the family living-room
where the charcoal stove daily burned, and the cooking-pots
stood against the wall.  "How soon?"
</p>

<p>
"By Allah! no later than an hour after sunrise, and that
delay is granted as an especial grace."
</p>

<p>
"And the mother of thy wife&mdash;the grandmother of thy
children&mdash;the guardian of thy house's honour&mdash;what of her?"
demanded Fatimeh; "Is she not one of the many decent ones
upon whose eyes the flies have sat in childhood?  Is&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Wallah</i>!  I had forgotten her," exclaimed the man in dismay.
For the mother of Fatimeh, at that moment congenially
engaged in crooning the latest new baby to sleep, in the inner
room dignified by the title of the <i>harîm</i>, had suffered in early
youth, like many other Egyptian women of the lower classes,
the loss, through ophthalmia, of one of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Now a faint grin showed on the face of her son-in-law, even
in the midst of his perplexity, as he said:
</p>

<p>
"Rebuke is justly mine, wife, that I did not remember it.
But by the border of thine <i>usbêh</i> I swear it!  Thy mother sees
more with her one eye than other women with two.  Yet would
I not part with her.  She is wise in dealing with the
teething-troubles of the lesser babes, and her slipper hath more sting
in it than thine, for the ruling of the elder.  We will send her
away to thy brother at Kantara until this scare of one-eyed
women is over and done.  Meanwhile,&mdash;" he glanced over his
shoulder at the door, and sitting on the hard-cushioned divan
that ran round three sides of the whitewashed room, drew
Fatimeh to sit beside him; "meanwhile I would speak to thee
of Khalid thine eldest.  Where is the boy to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"He is gone with his brother Amru to lay snares for fig-birds
in the orchard.  They must be set at moon-dark, for the
birds to enter them at dawn."
</p>

<p>
"He is a born hunter.  Seven years old this month of Safar,
and witful as he is handsome&mdash;the praise be unto Allah Who
makes them of all kinds!  Wife, if I told thee that the Presence,
seeing the boy so ripe for his tender years, and of goodly
promise, had bidden&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Nasr Ullah's tone had been studiously commonplace, but
the ridges in his high forehead had deepened, and his eyes had
an anxious stare.  He winced as his wife without a word slid
from the divan, and next instant lay prostrate on the
white-washed floor, with her forehead on his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay! ... My pearl, my joy! ... Take it not so
hardly! ..."
</p>

<p>
"O Everlasting, spare me this!  O husband, in pity, hear
me.  Hast thou forgotten Nasi, our joy and my firstborn?  He
would have been nine years old, this Nile-Rise....  Hast
thou forgotten?  Ay, ay, it was the old cry; 'This boy was
stupid&mdash;that one showed fear.  This must have known sin,&mdash;for
he could see nothing at all in the ink-pools or in the Eye
of Radiance.'  So the Presence takes my Nasi, and gives him
gifts and praises his excellence, and one day he comes home,
crying '<i>My head, my head!</i>' like the son of the woman who
fed the Prophet El Jah, peace be upon him!&mdash;and three days
later, thou, weeping bitter tears, dost hang my green-striped
shawl over the shabid of his tiny bier."
</p>

<p>
"Peace, wife!"
</p>

<p>
Sweat broke forth and stood on Nasr Ullah's face.  He
wiped it with the sleeve of his white <i>kaftan</i>, repeating:
</p>

<p>
"Peace, woman! ... It was a fever the boy had caught....
Dost thou not remember what the <i>hakim</i> said? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ay!  But I had watched by the bed of my sick child, and
shuddered at the visions he told of in his ravings.  O,
Husband, I have sat in the house one year, and thou hast said
in thine heart, '<i>She is forgetting</i>' ... Yet all the time&mdash;"  She
sat upright on the floor before him now, her strained eyes
glued upon his worried face, and the swift words poured from
her without his opposition.
</p>

<p>
"Peace! thou sayest.  How can there be peace in this house
where soothsayers and necromancers come and go, and the
sand-tables are forever cast, and fresh boys are brought each
new day to peer into the ink-pools....  Lo!  I will speak my
mind.  Ten years I have been thy wife, and a duteous and a
silent, but a mother in fear for her flesh and blood hath the
courage to defy Shaitan...."
</p>

<p>
"Be not disturbed....  I will find some way.  The boy
shall be sent to El Kantara with thy mother."
</p>

<p>
"And when my Agib is of likely age, will not the ink-pools
claim him?  Will the Presence have bowels to spare a child,
who in all these years hath loved no woman?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," was the reply.  "What need hath He of women, who
is in love with Life? ..."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis true.  Save when the Inglizi ladies come with their
menfolk to see the house and gardens, and eat fruit and drink
iced sherbets, and say 'charmin'&mdash;charmin'' and
'rippin'&mdash;rippin','" thus the better-half of Nasr Ullah rendered the
English slang, "no woman ever comes here.  What now?" for
the knee on which she rested her arm had jerked slightly.
</p>

<p>
"I had forgotten.  He hath said but now&mdash;that a woman
comes here at midnight!  No <i>râziye</i> of the Bazâr, or other of
the shameless, but a lady-Sahib from the Palace of Montana
at Iskanderieh....  The car brings her by the fifth hour....
The gates are to be open.  When the car has passed in, the
gates are to be shut and locked...."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ya rabbi!</i>"  The exclamation broke from the woman
involuntarily.  "After all these years&mdash;it may be that He
changes....  How old is He, husband?  Canst thou not even
guess? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps He is less old than He pretends, but He is many
years older than folks believe Him.  Of that there is no doubt
at all...."
</p>

<p>
"And it <i>is</i> done by devilry?  Witchcraft and spells&mdash;and
philtres?"  The woman breathed quickly.  "Say, is't not?"
</p>

<p>
"God knows!  But from whomever the Presence buys his
youth, He pays a heavy price for it.  See how He lives!  Even
as one who carries in his breast a stolen jewel, and goes in
fear lest it be snatched from him.  The pleasures of the
belly&mdash;He must shun them.  The joys that are tasted on perfumed
cushions&mdash;He must fly them one and all.  It is tyranny.  Yet
He thinks He is envied.  He is only wretched when Those I
may not speak of, ask&mdash;too high a price for the magical
drugs...."
</p>

<p>
"The drugs.  The devil-brews that keep Him youthful, who
else would be as dry and wrinkled as the mummies of the
ancient Kings?"
</p>

<p>
"Verily.  And&mdash;one thing I have seen of late&mdash;"  Once
launched upon the sea of Confidence, Nasr Ullah grew less
fearful.  "Whether Protection fails him, or the philtres lose
their power, I know not&mdash;but&mdash;He grows old!"
</p>

<p>
"I too!&mdash;"  Her eyes grew large with awe.  "I have fancied
He is somewhat changed...."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Chut</i>!  Do not interrupt.  It goes deeper than the skin&mdash;this
change that I have seen in him.  His moods vary like
those of a pregnant woman; he frames designs and throws
them aside as a monkey plucks, and bites, and casts bananas
away.  He does not even hate as He used to hate.  Once&mdash;if
an enemy rose up in the path, he removed that one with his
own hand, and troubled no more about the affair.  Or said
to one he trusted, '<i>Kill!</i>'" the tone was studiously smooth, the
speaker's face expressionless&mdash;"and that man or that woman
died&mdash;more quietly than the <i>bowab's</i> daughter who ate the
nectarine.  But now&mdash;since the killing of Usborn Sahib by
a Turk in Palestine,&mdash;and the night he dined at Iskanderieh
in the company of the big Jew Tomi&mdash;the Presence talks of
nought but sprinkling poisoned grain for carrier-doves and
dismissing of one-eyed females&mdash;and my heart is stricken with
fear for my lord!  Spells, and charms, and philtres bought
from Those in the Distant Places will not avail forever against
the day of Fate.  Azrael will come behind my lord with a touch
upon the shoulder.  The Black Camel of Allah will tread upon
his heel.  Then&mdash;even at a breath&mdash;the House of Life will
crumble!"  Nasr Ullah started to his feet as a silvery sound,
momentarily increasing in volume, rolled into the stuffy closed
room, and hummed about their ears.  "It is the gong from
my lord's room.  He calls, and I must go! ..."
</p>

<p>
He added, slipping the earthen pot of soaked and poisoned
barley within the bosom of his embroidered vest: "Sleep well,
my wife, if I see thee not ere morning.  And call in the
children&mdash;it is time they went to rest! ..."
</p>

<h3>
XVI
</h3>

<p>
This was another moonless night, with Orion glorious in the
East, and the Great Bear blazing on the northern horizon, as
the headlights of the high-powered Daimler car, driven by
the Italian chauffeur, flashed on a high, wide <i>porte cochère</i> of
white-painted wrought iron, and the horn sounded a
well-known call.
</p>

<p>
The massive gates were opened and shut by a hand-worked
windlass, over which ran an endless chain.  Two white-clad
negro porters worked the winch, the gate slid smoothly back
in its groovings.  The car rolled in, and the gate was shut as
it passed up the avenue.
</p>

<p>
The Arabian-Turkish palace seemed to sleep under the starshine
of the November night, wrapped in its royal mantle of
roses and bougainvillea.  Heavy drifts of perfume were
carried on the languid air-waves that came from the south-west
at intervals, swaying thick-foliaged branches and sighing
amongst the leaves.  Not a blue-white gleam of electric light
or even the flame of a candle twinkled through the pierced
lattices, as Katharine, alighting from the car, observed with
some surprise.
</p>

<p>
The wide-leaved doors of the house stood open.  On the
steps and in the vestibule were drawn up a double row of
native servants; lean, dark Mohammedans in high starched
turbans, <i>kaftans</i> and baggy trousers of snowy muslin,
displaying gorgeously gold-embroidered vests.
</p>

<p>
One elderly man stepped forward, salaaming low to the
visitor, with the words:
</p>

<p>
"O lady, God give thee a happy night!  His Presence awaits
thee."
</p>

<p>
"Carry thy lord salutations from me," Katharine answered
in her laboured Arabic.  "Say that&mdash;that I have come in
answer to the message.  Is the Saiyid Hazel here in the
house?"
</p>

<p>
The elderly man salaamed again and answered smoothly:
</p>

<p>
"Surely, O lady, the desire of thine eyes and thine heart
shall be granted!  With your coming a blessing hath entered
these doors...."
</p>

<p>
The Italian chauffeur now appeared behind Katharine, carrying
the suit-case.  A servant stepped forward and took it, as
Miss Forbis said to the chauffeur in French:
</p>

<p>
"I don't yet know whether I shall need that case.  Leave
it in the car, please, and let the car be waiting.  I may return
to Alexandria to-night."
</p>

<p>
"But, Mademoiselle!&mdash;" the Italian began, when a look from
Nasr Ullah silenced him.  He saluted, and muttering: "As
Mademoiselle commands!" turned and went out and down the
steps.  But he left the suit-case in the servant's hands&mdash;and
the hall-doors were shut and locked after him.  And the
fragrance of the jasmine and roses of the garden gave place to
another perfume, heavy too, but sickly-sweet with sandal and
henna, the fumes of burning pastilles, and all the strange
suggestive odours of a shut-up Eastern house.  And glancing at
the now barred doors and the double row of gleaming eyes,
and imperturbable dark faces, Katharine Forbis felt a little,
chilly shudder creep over her and stir amongst the roots of
her plentiful dark hair.
</p>

<p>
"A goose walked over my grave, then," she told herself,
smiling bravely, fighting back the sinister sensation, as the
elderly major-domo addressed her again:
</p>

<p>
"With permission, a message for the lady, from the Presence.
The Presence took food, as is his wont, a little after
sunset.  It is now the fifth hour, and supper has been spread,
Ifrangi-fashion, in readiness for the lady's coming.  If the
lady will deign to take of it, I pray her follow me...."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, but I need nothing," Katharine answered, as
the man prepared to lead the way down an interminable-appearing
hall.  "And&mdash;I prefer to stay where I am."  She
moved to a carved ebony seat, and spoke to the man again,
this time in English.  "Please ask Essenian Pasha and
Mr. Hazel to come to me here.  Unless&mdash;"  She started as the
thought occurred to her, and ended: "Unless they should
happen to be engaged with&mdash;some one who is ill...."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Aiyân</i>...."  The dark eyes under the much-ridged forehead
were wonderfully observant.  The nasal voice belonging
to the eyes spoke in the English tongue: "Surely there is one
here who is ill exceedingly.  The Presence and the Saiyid
Hazel have many fears for him," Nasr Ullah added as the
colour ebbed from Katharine's cheeks and lips and her hand
clenched involuntarily, "but by the Favour of Allah&mdash;he is
not like to die...."
</p>

<p>
"Take me to him....  Now, please! ..."
</p>

<p>
Miss Forbis rose up, tall and impetuous, motioning to Nasr
Ullah to lead the way, scattering her scruples and her fears
to the winds like withered leaves.  Which of her beloved Two
lay in some darkened room of this strange house?  Julian or
Edward?  Edward or Julian.  Well, in another minute she
would know....
</p>

<p>
It occupied several minutes.  The elderly Mohammedan produced
an electric torch, and by its radiance led her through
a vast suite of apartments on the ground-floor, their Arabesque
Ottoman elegance grotesquely overlaid with fashions imported
from the West.  A curious jumble of furniture of many
different styles and periods was revealed by the blue-white
torch-flare&mdash;overcrowding the wide and lofty rooms.  French
Directoire and the First Empire shouldered the Georgian
Regency, Early Victorian tables and Berlin wool-work settees
were reflected in splendid Venetian mirrors, and electric bulbs
depended from cut-glass chandeliers.  Later Rococo&mdash;overlaid
with Art Nouveau and camouflaged with Futurism; Cubist
pictures, Cubist draperies and cushions of Cubist designs,
gibbered mockingly in Katharine's face as the electric torch led
the way....  And the stuffiness bred of Eastern neglect hung
heavy on the atmosphere, and dust rose in wreaths from the
velvety carpets under the lightest tread.
</p>

<p>
The last door of the last suite led into a wide corridor paved
with black and white marble.  Midway down, the elderly
servant stopped at the grille of a lift and switched on the
electric light.  He snapped off his torch, pushed back the
sliding-door, followed Miss Forbis in, shut the grille and
started the elevator&mdash;a costly thing in nickel and enamelled
iron&mdash;conveying to Katharine the momentary impression that
she was calling on a London friend in a Sloane Street or
Mayfair flat.
</p>

<p>
The lift stopped at the top floor after traversing three
storeys.  The Mohammedan showed Miss Forbis out, and
opened a latticed door at the end of a short passage.  She
drew a breath of relief as the night-air flowed about her, and
the rose-scents of the dew-drenched garden rose up in
delicious clouds.
</p>

<p>
She was passing over a slender bridge, connecting the roof
of one of the wings of the Pasha's showy villa with that of
another building, evidently much older, distant perhaps some
forty feet from the ornate marble palace, and covering a
considerable area of ground in its rear.  Built in the old
windowless Arabian way about an oblong courtyard, and crowned by
an open court or pavilion of green and white marble, its outer
walls were pressed upon by closely thronging trees.
Casuarinas and moss-cup oaks, peppers and tamarisks and tall
waving palms made coolth and greenness round it, and
nightingales were singing from the trees that girt it round.
</p>

<p>
The bridge, of latticed iron, painted to dazzling whiteness,
ended under a pointed trefoil arch where heavy curtains hung.
The Mohammedan servant who showed the way was beckoning
to Katharine&mdash;lifting a gleaming, gold-embroidered fold,
signing to her to pass.  She drew in a deep breath of
fragrance from the garden, and the song of the bulbuls rose in a
crescendo of sweetness as she glanced at the starry sky.  Then
the dark hand signed to her&mdash;she passed under the archway,
and the curtain fell behind her with a soft, thudding sound.
</p>

<p>
She stood on the threshold of an oblong room, or rather,
court, of pierced and latticed marble, covered and adorned
with mosaic, running nearly the whole length of a side of the
Arab house.  Open to the sky overhead, and enclosed by
curtains of thick gold-embroidered silk, hanging under trefoil
arches between groups of slender pillars, it had a long divan
of dark, rich brocade running along one side.  Two silver
lamps of antique design, swinging by chains from slender
rods, mingled their mellow radiance with the starlight.  At
the farther end, closed curtains under a higher arch showed
the entrance to another court&mdash;or possibly an enclosed
apartment&mdash;beyond the pavilion that was canopied with the sky.
</p>

<p>
The floor was of ancient Arab tiles, wonderful in colour.
Rare and beautiful prayer-rugs were laid on it here and there.
A pedestal of serpentine supported a great porcelain bowl in
which a little fountain played, and goldfish were swimming.
Clusters of lilies of Amaryllis type, thick-stemmed, fleshy,
purple and white and crimson, exhaling a heavy, languorous
fragrance, stood in jars of ancient <i>cloisonné</i> upon inlaid ivory
stools.  In the centre of the room stood a broad divan, piled
with great embroidered cushions.  Beside the divan was a
tripod of ebony, supporting something that looked like a green
velvet jewel-case....
</p>

<p>
A slight man in Eastern dress, his black <i>tarbûsh</i> turbaned
with snowy muslin folds, his long-sleeved <i>kaftan</i> of
orange-red opening to reveal a longer-sleeved garment of white, a
jewelled pen-case glittering in the folds of his green silk girdle,
rose up from the divan as the curtain fell&mdash;and advanced to
Katharine....
</p>

<p>
"Dear lady, my poor house is highly honoured&mdash;" he began:
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr. Hazel here, Major Essenian?"
</p>

<p>
In her surprise at finding the Pasha alone, Katharine's
hurried query broke in upon the Pasha's formal welcome,
scattering his elaborate sentences to the winds.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hazel&mdash;"  He affected for a moment to search his
memory.  "Dear lady, I am sorry, but&mdash;"  His shrug said
"No! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did your chauffeur bring me the letter from
him?" Katharine demanded, looking down from her superb
height upon the suave and smiling face.
</p>

<p>
"From Mr. Hazel?" Essenian asked with maddening
blandness.  "Did he bring you a letter? ..."
</p>

<p>
"You know he did! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ah yes, of course, I know!" admitted Essenian, his long
eyes narrowing as they encountered Katharine's.  She mastered
her anger, knowing its display incautious, and said with
rather a poor attempt to smile:
</p>

<p>
"You must make allowances, Pasha, if I seem excited and
nervy.  But&mdash;I have been on tenterhooks since the day we met.
The 15th&mdash;and&mdash;isn't this the 18th of November? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, going by your Western calendar.  But in this
house that lies hidden behind another that is full of barbarous
Western inventions&mdash;Western customs do not prevail, and
Western fashions are abhorred.  You are in Egypt when you
are here...."
</p>

<p>
"The room is perfectly beautiful.  But I can't spare time to
enjoy it.  I can think of nothing but the matter that brought
me here to-night.  Last night, rather"&mdash;Katherine glanced at
her wrist-watch&mdash;"because it is getting perilously near one
o'clock in the morning.  Once for all, I ask you where you got
the letter that your servant brought me at the Hospital, nearly
five hours back? ..."
</p>

<p>
"It was placed in my hands by Hazel, to be delivered in case
of emergency."
</p>

<p>
Katharine's clear eyes questioned the dark face.  Its narrow
eyes met hers, glittering imperturbably.  She resumed, with a
little sickening thrill of hatred of the man:
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;the emergency has occurred?  Be good enough to
answer another question.  Did you take Mr. Hazel to Shechem,
as he told me you had arranged to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly.  We made the trip in record time."  The long
beryl eyes shone green in the mingling of lamplight and
starlight, the smooth dark lips curved as Essenian smiled.
"Following the old Pilgrim's Route at first.  Doing the
journey&mdash;about 195 miles, as the crow flies&mdash;in something under
three-and-a-half-hours, and reaching Shechem just before dawn."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;when you got there&mdash;what went wrong?  For something
has gone wrong," Katharine said breathlessly&mdash;"I feel it
in the air about me, though your face tells no tales."
</p>

<p>
"'<i>The face that tells tales is a man's worst enemy.  The
face that hides secrets is a man's best friend.</i>'"  Essenian
quoted the stale truism gently and suavely.  "But will you not
remove your outer wrap and take a seat on the divan?"
</p>

<p>
He added, as Katharine unfastened a cloak she wore, an
ample double cape of Navy blue serge, lined with dark crimson
silk, and dropped it from her shoulders, and moving with her
supple grace to the divan, sat down:
</p>

<p>
"I returned here yesterday, arriving before sunrise.  To
remain in Palestine would have been useless.  To be candid&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God!" said Katharine in her anguished soul.  "Does
this man ever speak candidly?"  But she looked at him and
waited&mdash;summoning up all her reserves of self-command and
patience, seeming a calm-eyed, superbly-moulded goddess,
attired in a well-cut uniform of white cotton-drill.
</p>

<p>
"I had arranged to return to Shechem," he went on, "before
sunrise on the 18th.  There is still time to reach there while
the day is yet young.  But something unfortunate happened
just before the landing.  In fact, Mr. Hazel has had an
accident&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"An accident.  Of what nature? ..."
</p>

<p>
Katharine's brows contracted and her colour faded.
Essenian pursued in his suavest tones:
</p>

<p>
"Let me explain.  To repose a confidence in you, which I
feel will not be misplaced."  Would the man never get to the
point?  "I employed at Shechem, a device of my own
invention&mdash;which has been approved at Headquarters by my Chief.
By a simple mechanical appliance&mdash;merely a spring-switch and
lock-clip&mdash;I can change the number and colour-plates on the
main-planes and tail of my machine.  You understand?  The
Red, White and Blue is replaced by the Red Crescent.  Imagine
the advantage to the aviator of a simple device like this!"
</p>

<p>
"But the type of your machine.  You can't change that!"
Katharine spoke wearily.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot, naturally.  But our captured 'planes are generally
brought into use.  And&mdash;I do not remain sufficiently long over
an enemy stronghold to give time&mdash;" the speaker shrugged and
ended&mdash;"for exhaustive scrutiny.  Let me be brief&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I beg that you will! ..."
</p>

<p>
He recognised in her voice an accent of entreaty.  It was
what he had waited for.
</p>

<p>
"I dropped&mdash;in my strictly temporary role of Turkish
aviator&mdash;a dummy despatch-bag into Shechem.  Then I flew
north, to a patch of level ground between Mount Ebal and
Samata&mdash;where I had planned to drop my man.  As I passed
south of Mount Ebal, I saw"&mdash;he was telling the story plainly
at last "there were enemy batteries upon it.  Mountain
Artillery of the Mustahfiz&mdash;machine-guns&mdash;a howitzer&mdash;the Mount
had been converted into a fortress of defence!  And, in my
surprise at the discovery, I acted without due caution&mdash;or
rather, I acted as I had arranged to act&mdash;without deviation
from the first plan.  I climbed, dived, and came down west of
the Mountain&mdash;giving Hazel the agreed-on-word to jump,
when I should touch the ground.  But&mdash;as a result of the
surprise, I suppose&mdash;I gave it prematurely&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And Mr. Hazel jumped&mdash;before you touched the ground!"
Her voice was very stern and deep.  Her wide gaze held him.
"Answer my question plainly.  Has he been killed? ..."
</p>

<p>
"No.  But he has sustained some hurt.  I do not know its
nature.  My military duty forbade me to remain."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;understand.  You flew away, leaving your passenger in
difficulties! ..."
</p>

<p>
The deadly contempt of the tone bit like frost at 15,000 feet,
the splendid wrath of her cairngorm eyes told him that he,
Essenian, was a creature infinitely mean....
</p>

<p>
"I flew away.  As you remark."  The glittering eyes met
hers at last, and the lips smiled cruelly....  "What would
you have?"  He folded his slender, dark hands within the
shelter of his sleeves.  "Can men fight against Destiny?"
</p>

<p>
"Men can fight against the temptation to do base things,
and sometimes fight and conquer.  And now&mdash;"  Anger and
grief were in her tone, "what will become of him? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Of your friend? ..."  He stood imperturbably facing her,
his dark hands hidden in the sleeves of his orange-crimson
<i>kaftan</i>, and the delicate mingling of golden lamplight and
silvery starlight threw his shadow over the rich, pale carpets, and
the exquisite Arabesque mosaics, of green and blue, and amber,
that covered with their tracery the exposed spaces of the floor.
"How can I say what has or will become of him! ... If you
choose, it is for you to tell me...."
</p>

<p>
An almost insupportable sense of the speaker's insincerity
went through Katharine's being like flame, and the agony of
suspense long drawn-out, spurred her&mdash;as Essenian had
calculated it would&mdash;to reckless utterance....
</p>

<p>
"How can I tell you?  You play with me, Major Essenian,
knowing as you must, that if I could find out what has
happened to my&mdash;to my friend and my brother I would do so at
any sacrifice! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said the Egyptian, gently and mellifluously, "place
yourself before the case that is on that tripod, open the case
and look in the spherical beryl it contains.  I will not touch it
lest you should suspect me of some trickery.  Indeed, I will
remain at a distance while you look....  All I ask is&mdash;that you
will tell me truthfully what you see&mdash;if Sight be vouchsafed
to you!  Judging by what I have witnessed I believe you will
be favoured.  No sacrifice is needed....  You have only to
look! ..."
</p>

<p>
He lowered his voice almost to a whisper, yet every word
came to Katharine's hearing with a distinctness that oppressed.
</p>

<p>
"After our meeting in Mr. Hazel's house at Alexandria,
where I had witnessed such a striking manifestation of his
clairvoyant powers, he dined with me at my Club, and after
dinner&mdash;in my eagerness to pursue further the investigations
that absorb me&mdash;I persuaded Hazel to look in the beryl that
case contains.  He passed with ease into the condition
inseparable from Vision&mdash;but to my questions I received no
satisfactory replies.  Now that you are here," the voice was
hurried, "the hour and the conditions alike being favourable,
stretch out your hand, open the case and&mdash;look in the crystal
ball!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you really think that I should see&mdash;things?  Find out
what is happening to&mdash;friends at Shechem?"
</p>

<p>
Essenian's orange-red draperies rustled as he moved nearer,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"I do not 'think.' ... I know that you would! ..."
</p>

<p>
Holding his breath, he saw her white figure shift its position
on the divan.  Now her white hands hovered like wistful doves
about the velvet case on the tripod&mdash;now the moony brightness
of the great spherical beryl shone forth as though some
lesser star of the innumerable hosts of heaven had fallen upon
the tripod in the Arabian room....  Now he heard her
say&mdash;speaking to herself rather than to him&mdash;with a fluttered laugh
of nervousness:
</p>

<p>
"You know, I won't have anything to do with this if it's
dabbling in magic.  But&mdash;just to look in the beryl can't be
much harm...."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  What harm could there be?  But wonderful
things are seen&mdash;sometimes&mdash;by gifted people.  And you&mdash;I
would stake half that I own on the certainty that you have
the gift! ..."
</p>

<p>
He moved softly here and there in the background as Katharine,
absorbed, bent over the beryl.  Now he loosened a silken
cord, and shades descended, covering the silver lamps.  He
moved his dark, supple hands among little brazen vases of
Benares-work ranged upon a stand resembling a Hindu altar,
and a slender column of incense, heavy and fragrant, rose up
and climbed, spiralling and twisting, towards the great stars
that looked down from Heaven's violet dome.  Presently he
heard Katharine whisper to herself as a woman speaks in
dreaming:
</p>

<p>
"The Church forbids dabbling in spiritism and magic.  But
just&mdash;once to look&mdash;can't be so very wrong! ..."
</p>

<p>
And now Essenian spoke, seizing the appropriate moment,
almost as he had spoken to Hazel at the Club:
</p>

<p>
"Wrong....  How should it be wrong?  Do not touch the
beryl&mdash;that is imperative.  Neither bend so close above it that
your breathing dims its light.  Sit comfortably, rest your hands
lightly on either side of the tripod.  You are not afraid?  Why
should you be?  There is absolutely no reason....  Only look
steadily in the beryl, do not remove your eyes...."
</p>

<p>
If Katharine had seen Essenian's, as they narrowly observed
her, she might have recalled a speech of Lady Wastwood's,
made a few days previously.  For they indubitably resembled
the eyes of a cobra, and his soft noiseless movements were
horribly tigerish.  But she knew nothing but the cold, gleaming
sphere upon its little cup-shaped metal pedestal&mdash;and the
smooth twists and coiling folds, suggesting veil upon veil of
mystery&mdash;that were beginning to reveal themselves beneath the
pale-green, shining surface that at first had seemed opaque.
There was a singing in her ears, and she heard her heart
throbbing, but as though it were the heart of some one
else beating a long way off.  Edward's? ... Julian's? ... Neither
of these, she thought....  The heart that called so far
away was John Hazel's....  What was he doing?  Where was
he?  What had happened to him?  Summoning all her
strength, she willed herself to see....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Oh, oh!  Take it away! ... Hide it from me! ..."
</p>

<p>
Katharine was moaning, and begging not to see.  And the
Egyptian, ashen of hue, dabbled with sweat, vibrating like a
wind-blown reed&mdash;was bending towards her, greedily drinking
in the disconnected utterances that broke from her&mdash;when she
sighed deeply, lifted her head, and fixed her eyes on him.
</p>

<p>
"Go on!  Go on!  Look back to the beryl!"  He lifted his
slender clenched hand as though he would have struck her.
"Do you want to ruin all?  Why do you stop? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Because it makes my eyes and my head ache so...."  She
opened and shut her eyes once or twice, and rubbed her
forehead with her handkerchief.  "And because what I saw
was horrible&mdash;that was why I stopped!"
</p>

<p>
"What did you see?  ..."
</p>

<p>
"The inside of a wooden hut.  Dirty and sordid&mdash;with no
furniture in it except a native bed.  All seen as by daylight,
through high-powered binoculars.  And&mdash;on the bed&mdash;chained
to it&mdash;"  She shuddered&mdash;"Something shapeless&mdash;something
bloody&mdash;something terrible&mdash;that once may have been a
man&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Was it your brother?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thank&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! ..."  He stopped her with an imperative gesture.
"How do you know that it was not Father Forbis? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Because Julian is very fair, with reddish hair and beard.
The monks of his Order wear the beard like the Franciscans."
</p>

<p>
"Was it John Hazel?  Answer! ..."
</p>

<p>
"I dare not say! ..."
</p>

<p>
"You know it was!" He almost spat the words at her.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps.  Oh! what have they done to him? ..."  Katharine's
nerves were thrilling&mdash;little intermittent shudders
passed over her, cold damps stood upon her skin, and her heart
shook her as she sat.  She fought for composure, steadying
her lips, drying her dewy temples with her handkerchief, "I
have seen things in War," she panted, "but nothing worse than
that!  Pray order the car!&mdash;I must go back to Alexandria."  She
repeated, thinking he did not hear her.  "Have the
kindness to order the car! ..."
</p>

<p>
He had moved round in front of her, and stood regarding
her with his arms crossed upon his breast.  Now he said in his
velvet tones: "Not until you have looked again in the beryl,
Miss Forbis.  And for me&mdash;for me, this time!"
</p>

<p>
"You threaten to detain me here against my will?  I should
not advise your trying it!"  She rose up, dwarfing him by her
superb stature, adding as she lifted her mantle from the divan:
"You do not suppose that my friends at Montana are ignorant
of my whereabouts?  Besides, your car was challenged at
all the guarded barriers, and more than once stopped upon the
road here by patrols of Military Police.  The chauffeur
supplied your number and name, and I naturally took care to
give my own, 'Sergeant-Motor-driver, K. Forbis, Number 61,
&mdash;th Unit, V.A. Department, Red Cross....'  This is the
Twentieth Century, Major Essenian...."
</p>

<p>
"I threaten nothing.  I suggest nothing," the supple hands
were extended towards her, palms uppermost, "I have no
designs against your honour.  I am of those who see the
grinning skull behind the Face of Loveliness and the asp that
conceals itself beneath the blossom of the rose."  He spoke
rapidly, illustrating his sentences with swift, expressive gestures:
"I merely entreat of you, at this juncture in my fortunes&mdash;a
man beset with dangers from sources all unknown!&mdash;look
in the beryl!  Ask of me what you choose&mdash;I am wealthy
enough to give it you!&mdash;but first look in the beryl, and will
to see my Fate."
</p>

<p>
"Very well."  The womanliness inherent in Katharine
stirred her, in spite of her dislike, to pity the desperate anxiety
patent in the Egyptian's twitching face, and nervous, appealing
hands.  "But your attempt at coercion was as misplaced
as your suggestion of bribery.  You will not repeat either, if
you are wise.  Since you entreat it, I consent to look once
more in the beryl.  But first&mdash;order the car...."
</p>

<p>
"I am your slave, and all I possess is at your service!"  He
took a silver rod from a stand, and struck a small gong.  It
had a wonderful resonance, and the sonorous note evoked,
spread in waves increasing in volume, until, the limit of its
power reached, the sound ebbed away.
</p>

<p>
"That was to summon the car.  Now, look&mdash;"  Essenian
threw fresh incense on the burning embers in the censer on
the altar, muttering an invocation in his own tongue: "O ye
Influences, be propitious!  O Tarshun, O Taryushun!  Come
down!  Come down!  Remove the veil from the woman's
sight.  Show her my Fate in the Eye of Radiance.  Hear, O
Arhmân!  Great Prince&mdash;thy servant calls! ..."
</p>

<p>
Bending over the beryl, resting her hands on the tripod,
turning a deaf ear to the inward voice that warned her not to
look, Katharine saw in the body of the stone, framed in silky,
shining skeins of semi-opaque lustre, a little oval vignette of
her own face, crowned by the slouched felt uniform hat, with
its badge and ribbon banding, backed by the purple splendour
of the jewelled Eastern sky.  She put up a hand and removed
her hat, and tossed it aside carelessly, without removing her
gaze from the sinister, gleaming sphere....  Then the pale
face with the intent eyes faded from vision, a wider space
began to clear between the silky folds....
</p>

<p>
"Essenian Pasha&mdash;I will to see the Fate of Essenian!" she
repeated mentally, concentrating her powers.  The will to see
became intense.  She forgot her loathing of the man, muttering
incoherent things, shivering with suspense behind her: "I
will to see! ... I will to see!" she told herself over and over.
And Seeing came as Katharine framed the words, with dazzling,
illuminating clearness.  As previously, she might have
been looking through high-powered binoculars.
</p>

<p>
She saw a whitewashed brick courtyard, clean and bare and
sanded, in early daylight, with blank brick walls on three
sides, and plain brick buildings on the fourth side, where two
sentries with fixed bayonets guarded a door.  Drawn up in
the courtyard in two lines, a company of R.F.C. officers,
N.C.O.'s and men, stood at attention.  The door opened, the
sentries presented arms, and a Sergeant-Major and party of
Military Police, with fixed bayonets, led by an officer wearing
a Staff brassard, and followed by four other Police, carrying
a plain, wooden coffin&mdash;marched into the courtyard, escorting
a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner was Essenian&mdash;in khaki as she had first seen
him&mdash;save that his multi-coloured rows of ribbons, and the
badges on his uniform, had been ruthlessly slashed away.  The
man himself was altered, shrunken, aged beyond believing.
His grey face with its glittering eyes staring from caves that
had been dug about them, lifted as the Sergeant-Major
touched his shoulder&mdash;took off his cork helmet&mdash;bandaged his
eyes carefully&mdash;opened his khaki tunic and hung a
white-painted metal disc immediately above his heart....
</p>

<p>
Now they were putting down the coffin before a blank wall.
Now the little shrunken figure stood against the wall in tragic
solitude&mdash;the Sergeant-Major was placing seven men in line
confronting it, taking their rifles from them, and showing
them, one at a time to the officer with the Staff brassard....
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ready...!  Present....!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The rifles had been given back, and seven muzzles steadily
pointed at the white disc hanging on the doomed man's breast.
In another second&mdash;sharp stabs of greenish flame leaped
beyond the shining bayonets, light puffs of brownish smoke rose
against the dazzling blue sky seen above the wall....
</p>

<p>
The shrunken body lay huddled up, in an odd unnatural
attitude, in a dark red puddle that soaked away in the sand.
The officer with the Staff brassard approached it, drawing his
revolver....  He stooped down, straightened himself, glanced
back at the Sergeant, and slipping the revolver back into its
holster, gave an order, wheeled sharply and walked away.
And as he did this the whole scene blurred and vanished.
With a slight, sharp sound like the snapping of a crystal rod,
a jagged fracture showed down the middle of the Eye of
Radiance.  The Beryl had become opaque as a lump of volcanic
glass.

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<p>
"What have you seen? ..."  A fierce breath beat on
Katharine's cheek, and a steel-strong grip was on her arm, as
Essenian's swift whisper assailed her ear: "Deny not that you
saw!&mdash;the stone splits&mdash;that is enough!&mdash;it means the end for
me!  I am deceived&mdash;" the shrill voice cracked despairingly&mdash;"I
to whom They promised Life&mdash;Life prolonged beyond the
age of elephants&mdash;Youth that should keep its freshness like
the flower in the block of ice.  Speak, woman, say what you
have seen, or by Eblis!  I will make you!  I am strong yet,
and if Azrael's hand be at my throat, you shall feel mine at
yours!"
</p>

<p>
Even as he leaped, Katharine swung out a long arm, striking
him across the body, breaking the force of his leap, as she
remembered to have once done when a savage cat, crossed
with the wild breed, had crept up behind, unnoticed, and
sprung upon her to bite.
</p>

<p>
"You native cad!" rang her clear disdainful voice.  "Are
you out for murder?"
</p>

<p>
"I am out to make you tell me&mdash;"  Breathing unevenly, he
stood back from the divan, his supple body tense for a second
spring, his glittering eyes watching her: "What have you seen
in the beryl?  Answer!&mdash;it is my right to hear!"
</p>

<p>
"But not your right to lay hands upon an Englishwoman,"
Katharine retorted, tingling with insulted pride.  "Do not
attempt it again, because I carry a revolver, and like most
women who have served in this War, I have learned to use
it well!"
</p>

<p>
Brave words, yet her head was swimming as she spoke, and
her heart throbbed suffocatingly, and the hand that gripped
the butt of the little Colt's revolver, shook with the rigor of
fear.  The strange and terrible experiences of the night&mdash;horror
of Essenian's vicinity and touch, the strain of long
anxiety and protracted fasting&mdash;were beginning to tell upon
Katharine.  She despised women who fainted at dreadful
sights or in perilous situations, and yet&mdash;she realised herself
not far from fainting now....
</p>

<p>
Air&mdash;she was famishing for want of air! though the room
was open to the stars and the night-winds&mdash;though the
curtains behind that tigerish orange-red figure were bellying and
parting, blown inwards under their pointed triple arches by a
gale she could not feel.  She could see the branches of the
thronging trees&mdash;the lateral limb of a towering moss-cup oak
swaying strangely under the weight of a climbing brown
figure.  She caught the flash of eyes and teeth in a shadowy
face topped by a white sun-helmet&mdash;and ran towards the
archway as a man leaped into the room....
</p>

<p>
Others followed, dropping from the great elbowed tree-limb
to the wall, and jumping through the archway....  Men in
the well-known khaki drill, with sun-browned or pale
European faces under their sun-helmets&mdash;and the red brassard
of the Military Police....
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, but I have to arrest you, Major Essenian, in the
name of the King...."
</p>

<p>
A young Lieutenant of M.P. with a tooth-brush moustache
of undeniable ginger was pressing a folded paper on Essenian
and mopping his own dripping face....
</p>

<p>
"Warm work, shinning up trees in this muggy Egyptian
climate.  But I fancy we've dropped in just at the right
time...  Certainly for the lady.  Sergeant Whitmore, look
to the lady.  Handcuff the prisoner, Corporal Rose.  And,
Major, remember that anything you say will be used against
you in evidence."
</p>

<p>
"There will be&mdash;there will be a formal Court Martial?"  He
raised his face, the grey face, pinched and sweat-dabbled, that
Katharine had seen in the vision of the Stone: "I demand
it!&mdash;I demand it!  Whatever the charges on this warrant which
I have not read, remember!&mdash;I can disprove them&mdash;I can
confute them&mdash;establish my honour in the face of the world."
</p>

<p>
"You'll be lucky if you do!  No, you can't change into
uniform.  One of your servants can pack a kit-case, and leave it
for you at the Military Clink.  That's your address&mdash;while
you require one.  Hit that tin gong, will you, Corporal?  It'll
fetch some of these Gyppo fellows to show the way to the
hall-door."
</p>

<p>
"I can guide you, Mr. Martyn!"
</p>

<p>
"Holy Smoke, it's Miss Forbis from Montana!  How in
the wide&mdash;  I beg your pardon!"
</p>

<p>
The Lieutenant&mdash;not so long ago a convalescent patient at
the Hospital, broke off the end of the question, reddening, but
Katharine answered with her broad, sweet smile, looking in
the boyish face with candid cairngorm eyes:
</p>

<p>
"How in the wide did I come here?  Well, I'll tell you
strictly in confidence&mdash;in return for a lift back to Alexandria.
Can do? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Can do!  Off duty&mdash;as soon as I've delivered the goods at
the M.P."  His glance at the goods was highly expressive:
"<i>'Hê intē!  Ya rajîl!</i>"  This to an elderly Mohammedan
servant with a much-ridged forehead of anxiety&mdash;Nasr Ullah,
summoned in haste to the Pavilion by an alien stroke upon the
Presence's gong.  "Oh, you!  Show us the way downstairs!"
</p>

<p>
"I will go, I will go!  Do not handle me roughly....
Remember that I am an old&mdash;a very old man!  Miss Forbis, I
knew your father once!  Speak for me!  Use your influence!
Remember," the quavering voice broke in a fit of senile
coughing, the manacled hands extended to Katharine in
supplication, looked like those of a mummy, so discoloured and
shrunken were they: "You do not answer?  You triumph in
my downfall?"  The narrow eyes glimmered hatred out of
their deep-dug caves.  "Do not forget your brother, and your
friend, Mr. Hazel&mdash;whose fate is practically in my hands!"
</p>

<p>
"Their fate is in the Hands of God," Katharine answered
gently, moving beyond the reach of the withered, trembling
clutch.  "Like yours and mine, and that of every other
creature.  Good-bye, Major Essenian...."
</p>

<p>
He made no reply.  He was muttering to himself, and
looked, indeed, an old man.  His head fell on his breast as
the word to move was given&mdash;and the party of policemen, with
the orange-robed figure tottering in their midst&mdash;tramped over
the white bridge in the bluish-pale light of the small hours,
and followed by Katharine and the Lieutenant, went down
through the airless house....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When the tail-light of the last of the string of the four
Military Police cars had winked past the turn in the avenue,
and the <i>porte cochère</i> was closed, Nasr Ullah went back to his
"house" and found her waking.  She hastened out of the inner
apartment and ran to him in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my eyes!  Oh, my husband!  <i>Alhamdolillah</i> thou hast
returned to us!  Little sleep have we had this night.  Strange
scrapings at the back of the house, and whistles as of Afrits
talking....  The children woke and wept, and I scarce had
wits to lie to them&mdash;thinking the Servants of Eblis were
carrying the Presence away! ..."
</p>

<p>
"The Presence hath gone, sure enough, but Inglizi soldiers
took him.  Always I have known," said Nasr Ullah, "that
some day the soldiers would come.  They followed the woman
secretly, climbing the trees like monkeys, and leaped in upon
the Presence when she cried out....  Perhaps she was a
spy&mdash;God knows! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to Him the soldiers took thee not also!  Tell
me&mdash;in this matter of the pigeons....  Didst thou&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Nasr Ullah shook his head:
</p>

<p>
"My heart was straitened when I left thee,&mdash;but Allah
enlightening me&mdash;I dealt wisely.  For at the compound of the
Commandant&mdash;at the Headquarters of Intelligence and at Garrison
Headquarters&mdash;one grain of barley threw I at each place,&mdash;and
picked it up again!  Then, burying the pot and the grain
in a place where none will find them&mdash;I returned at the fourth
hour, and said to the Presence&mdash;'Lo!  I have done thy bidding,
in the casting of poisoned barley.'  And in this I spake the
very truth, yet Nûh's birds are safe for me!"
</p>

<p>
"It is well.  The Compassionate shielded thee.  Think you,
my husband, the Presence will return?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not, but if he does, he will not find Nasr Ullah.  The
Eye of Radiance is broken, so even did he look in it he could
not find me.  The Englishmen have opened his <i>maktabs</i> and
taken all his papers.  Come, let us take the children, and thy
jewels, and our money and the best of the clothing and go
away from here!"
</p>

<p>
"When the fleas leave the cat, he is dead!" said Fatimeh
acutely.
</p>

<p>
"No flea am I!" denied Nasr Ullah stoutly.  "Forty-two
years have I served The Presence, and by Allah!  I have
served him well and faithfully.  Now, I shall serve Allah, Who
is the better Master, and my sons shall grow up without
knowledge of ink-pools and wizardry...."
</p>

<p>
"And the bag that is buried under the bed hath enough in
it to buy thee a homestead.  Verily the Beneficent hath
hearkened to my prayers.  Go we by day, or now?"
</p>

<p>
"Now.  Make haste and dress the children&mdash;hide thy jewels
about thee."  He looked round for something to dig with,
and picked up a big brass ladle.  "Strange, how a man may
feel like a thief in digging up his own hoard!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Will there&mdash;is there likely to be a Court Martial?" Katharine
asked the Lieutenant, as some hours later, a Police Ford
Car, diverted from official use for the purposes of chivalry,
ran between green fields of fodder on the road by the Canal,
and the Lieutenant&mdash;having fed his charge with sandwiches
of cold chicken, hard eggs, ripe figs and bananas, and hot coffee
out of a thermos&mdash;was pressing Turkish cigarettes on her and
offering a light.
</p>

<p>
"Something in the nature of one, possibly.  But precious
short, and to the point.  I'm not broaching official secrets!&mdash;but
the evidence is solid.  We've had quite a cloud of witnesses
to prove that the Pasha has been playing the kind of trick
with the British Government that he tried to play on you.
There were two of our Secret Intelligence men, in Shechem,
one of 'em a prisoner in the Barracks and the other in disguise.
And he was twice seen by these chaps to shed despatches into
the town-square...."
</p>

<p>
"But weren't the despatches dummies?" Katharine asked.
</p>

<p>
"That was the tale he fed 'em with at H.Q., but it won't
wash!"&mdash;the owner of the ginger toothbrush shook his head:
"We've got hold of the last lot and they're genuine enough.
Seditious propaganda&mdash;from centres in the Far East&mdash;that's
the sort of stuff he's been dropping in Palestine....  What's
more&mdash;it has just come out that he murdered his observer&mdash;the
S.I. man who was shut up with the other War Prisoners in the
Barracks saw the thing done&mdash;in mid-air over Shechem&mdash;just
as he'd focussed his binnics on Essenian's machine.  'The
Two-Faced Nightingale,' the War Prisoners used to call her&mdash;because
of her transferable number and colour-plates&mdash;a clever
invention of the Pasha's, you see...."
</p>

<p>
"But I thought they'd approved of the invention at
Headquarters? ..."
</p>

<p>
Said the Lieutenant, with a shrewdness that went curiously
with his youthful face:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, right enough, the Brass Hats approved of the invention!
But they didn't approve of its being approved of," he
twinkled at the alliteration&mdash;"by the fellows on the other
side.  The man's a dud!  And he's jolly well earned what's
he's going"&mdash;he looked at his wrist-watch&mdash;"what he's bound
to get&mdash;half-an-hour after morning gun."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Boom!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Even as the Lieutenant spoke, the radiant air vibrated, and
flocks of swallows, newly arrived, scared by the detonation,
rose and wheeled shrieking over the Fortress of Alexander's
Town....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Hospital was already astir as Katharine passed in.
She did not go at once to the sleeping-tent she shared with Lady
Wastwood, but passed the white rows of canvas dwellings, and
turned into the dewy, deserted gardens, where odours of Eden
breathed from the newly opened roses, and all the thrushes and
blackbirds and bulbuls were singing in chorus to greet the birth
of another day.
</p>

<p>
Her glance sought the table where she had left the card and
the letter.  They were not there.  Lady Wastwood must
have taken them.  One could always count on Trixie for such
kind, considerate acts.
</p>

<p>
She threw down her hat and the serge uniform-cape on
the table and stepped out upon the terrace to drink in the
sweet coolness, resting her hands on the balustrade as she
looked out over the gardens, and the Khedive's boasted
tennis-lawns of rafia&mdash;beyond the belt of palms, evergreen oaks,
tamarisks and stone pines and rustling casuarinas, that clothe
the slopes of Montana, to the changing blues and beryls of the
classic Western Sea.
</p>

<p>
Among the cistus-blossoms at her feet, the early bees were
humming; orioles were busy weaving their nest in the overhead
vine.  A light step sounded on the mosaic floor behind
her.  Trixie had come out to look for her.  No&mdash;not Trixie!
A sudden shock passed through her.  Her heart leaped and
seemed to stop, then went on beating furiously.  She felt,
without knowledge, that Edward Yaill was near....
</p>

<p>
Waves of carnation swamped her creamy fairness.  Great
waves of joy surged in her heart.  She held her breath and
looked down at the white hands folded before her on the
creamy stone of the balcony....
</p>

<p>
The hand that lay uppermost wore the ancient gem of Hercules.
Now a breath fanned upon her neck, the subtle scents
of the Desert surrounded and enveloped her, an arm in a khaki
sleeve gently stole round her, and a familiar hand covered the
onyx ring....  Yaill's hand.  Beautiful and strong, masculine
and soldierly even in its slimness, scorched to the colour of
lion-hide by savage Asian suns.
</p>

<p>
"O!  Edward....  O my man of men!  God gives you back
to me! ...."
</p>

<p>
"Sweetheart!  Dear woman!  I had not hoped for this! ..."
</p>

<p>
Wonderful, unexpected boon.  Heaven's manna to the starving.
His Katharine's heart upon his own, her lips as freely
yielded as though the hateful barrier had never risen between....
Soon he would wake, Yaill told himself&mdash;to aching
desolation.  But for a little he would take what Katharine granted
him.
</p>

<p>
"Julian? ..."  She started in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Julian is safe, my sweetheart, but not yet fit to travel.  I
left him in the best of care, at G.H.Q. at Lydd.  The
General got me a passage down by one of their coasting
sea-planes.  A Sopwith from the 'Raquin'&mdash;and she did it in
splendid time, too!  Another kiss! ... For a fellow who has lived
on memories of kisses&mdash;since that day we parted at Kerr's
Arbour, Katharine!  How your letter brought the whole
thing back, when it came to me at the Khan at Shechem...."
</p>

<p>
"By John Hazel? ..."
</p>

<p>
"A woman brought it, certainly&mdash;but Hazel sent it me...."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Edward, where is he?  You do not answer! ..."  She
drew away from Yaill, looking in his troubled face.
"Where is John Hazel? ..."
</p>

<p>
"I would give much to tell you! ..."
</p>

<p>
"You mean that he is dead? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Frankly, we fear the worst.  When we escaped from
Shechem, Hazel was lame through an accident.  He would not
hamper us&mdash;he stayed behind to keep the road.  The road
to Kir Saba....  It runs through a defile among the
mountains&mdash;just where a Turkish ammunition-lorry had broken
down...."
</p>

<p>
"Go on! ..."
</p>

<p>
"For long after we had passed we heard bombs bursting.
There seemed to be any amount of fighting going on at that
point on the road.  Then there was an explosion&mdash;the lorry
had blown up sky-high.  We learned that the day after, when
a British scouting-'plane came back from reconnaissance in the
neighbourhood.  There were&mdash;human <i>débris</i> upon the road&mdash;and
several dead horses.  If Hazel is dead&mdash;and I fear he is&mdash;he
died as a man should die...."
</p>

<p>
"But if he is not dead?"  Her great eyes held his: "If he
were imprisoned in&mdash;a wooden hut, chained down upon a
native bed&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  Yaill started.  "Have you dreamed
you saw him so?  There was a wooden hut in the War
Prisoners' Wired Enclosure at Shechem.  Julian was there when
we found him&mdash;chained as you describe!"
</p>

<p>
"It was not Julian whom I saw&mdash;somewhere between midnight
and two o'clock this morning&mdash;but John Hazel...."  She
shuddered, "John Hazel, so brutally ill-used&mdash;so frightfully
disfigured, that the thing chained to the <i>anghareb</i> was
like anything but a man....  Yet I knew him.  You cannot
mistake his eyes, once you have seen them.  He is alive&mdash;and
a prisoner.  O Edward, it was no dream!&mdash;I tell you that
I saw!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Since you feel like that," Yaill caught fire at the flame of
her intense conviction, "I'll go back&mdash;in another skin&mdash;and
fine-comb the Front for him."
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear Edward!  That would be great of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Not it.  I am the man's debtor.  He brought me word of
you at Sheria, and afterwards at Shechem.  Shall I ever forget
the thrill it gave&mdash;the sight of that envelope with your
handwriting!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but there were two letters...."  Remembrance flooded
her.  "Didn't you read the other?  I don't believe you have!"
</p>

<p>
"Frankly, there was no time.  But I have it here upon
me."
</p>

<p>
He felt in a baggy side-pocket of his khaki Service jacket,
pulled out a crumpled buff envelope, and held it out to her.
</p>

<p>
"Read it now, Edward!  O Edward, read it! ..."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her whimsically, and opened Nurse Pidge's
letter.  When he began to read, Katharine was standing.
When he looked round, she was seated in a chair.  He crossed
the floor and knelt by her, and her yearning arms went out
to him, and drew him home from exile, to the shelter of her
breast.

<h3>
XVIII
</h3>

<p>
Towards dawn, following the bomb-fight on the Jaffa Road,
those masses of sulphurous cumulo-nimbus, piled over the
Hills of Gilead, move without the push of a wind behind
towards the damp rain-clouds rolling inland from the
Mediterranean, and there is a great thunderstorm over Shechem.
Forked lightning strikes and splits the rocks, the echoes of
Nebo and Gerizim bellow in answer to the rattling volleys of
cloud-artillery.  Wadis and passes became foaming cataracts,
field-bivouacs are flooded&mdash;men and guns are bogged in the
foot-deep mud of the hill-roads&mdash;and supply-columns of British
A.S.C. hopelessly held up in the vast cotton-soil morass
that was yesterday the Maritime Plain.
</p>

<p>
By noon of the next day the sun regains sway, and the smells
of Shechem their wonted potency.  Save for one Turkish sentry
at the gate, the guard has been removed from the Wired
Enclosure.  In its littered desolation an offence to the eye&mdash;in
its neglected filth an outrage to the adjacent organ, it lies and
steams and festers under the baking rays; and all the winged
legions of Baal Zebub seem there to be holding revel&mdash;especially
in the neighbourhood of the wooden hut.
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours after noon the Enclosure is visited by
the Bey.  The <i>posta</i> at the gate stiffens to the salute as Hamid
passes in with the gauze-spectacled Medical Officer and his
bilious-looking secretary, his nondescript Greek interpreter,
and his usual following of big-bearded, red-fezzed <i>zabtiehs</i>,
armed with German Service revolvers, and repeating Winchesters.
</p>

<p>
The fog of flies about the wooden hut thins a little as the
visitors approach its entrance.  The heavy door&mdash;broken
now&mdash;stands as wide as though no prisoner were within worth
keeping.  The odour of corruption fills the place.  The Bey spits,
the Turkish Medical Officer in the black gauze spectacles
furtively sucks a formamint lozenge, and conveys one to the
interpreter&mdash;the Secretary holds his nose....
</p>

<p>
The wooden bed has been dragged aside from the patch of
ground it covered, where shows the mouth of the tunnel, which
has been hastily filled up with brickbats, sand, and gravel.
Flies rise in a roaring cloud from the bedstead as the visitors
enter, and the Bey, with a pale twinkle in his oblique sandy
eyes&mdash;the inevitable cigarette poised between his thick gloved
fingers&mdash;perpetrates one of his inimitable jests:
</p>

<p>
"Come, see a greedy dog we have in here&mdash;a Yahudi of the
Yahud, who has eaten stick till his belly burst, and now can
eat no more! ..."
</p>

<p>
At which display of wit the fat, goggled surgeon squirms
with laughter, the secretary and the interpreter, faint with
mirth, retire to the threshold, and even the flies buzz as though
they too appreciated the jest....
</p>

<p>
The Thing that lies upon the bed looks as though it, too,
joined in the merriment, for its teeth are set, and the swollen
lips drawn back&mdash;the Medical Officer learnedly explains&mdash;in
the rigor of the early stages of tetanus, so that it grins from
ear to ear.  A mountainous bulk of bloody flesh, clothed in a
garment of feasting flies, and bound about with an iron chain
that is padlocked under the <i>anghareb</i>&mdash;he is no more than the
caricature of what was once a man.
</p>

<p>
A man who has suffered the extremest punishment of the
<i>falagy</i>.  Who has been beaten by the lithe green rods on the
feet and legs, on the belly and breast, on the loins and thighs
and face....  Beaten to kill by relays of men, skilled in the
use of the <i>asayisi</i>, and yet, for a wonder, is not dead....
</p>

<p>
Labouring breaths issue from the bloated lips, and puff from
the split nostrils.  In the glazed eyes staring from their bleeding
orbits, black fire smoulders still....  He is even capable
of a croaking sound, which he reiterates at intervals, with his
bleeding eyes begging at the faces of those beside his bed....
</p>

<p>
"<i>So' ûk sû! ... So' ûk sû! ...</i>"
</p>

<p>
All the Turkish the sufferer knows: "Cold Water!&mdash;cold
water! ..."
</p>

<p>
"O Jew! you will get no cold water between here and Hell.
But stick&mdash;plenty more stick, if you are noisy."  Thus the
Bey, illustrating the humour of the words with eloquent
pantomime.
</p>

<p>
"Do not beat me any more!" the wretched being on the bed
stutters in broken Arabic: "Do not call the soldiers&mdash;beg the
Bey to be merciful!"  Bright red blood jets between the
clenched teeth&mdash;his cracked tongue being moistened with this,
his utterance becomes clearer: "Tell Hamid Bey if he will let
me go, I can pay&mdash;I can pay him well!  ..."
</p>

<p>
"Thou canst pay?  That is speaking Osmanli sense."  A
flat pasty face with oblique, pale, lashless eyes, and sandy
eyebrows, replaces the spectacled surgeon's.  "How canst thou
pay?"
</p>

<p>
"By&mdash;telling&mdash;but I will tell no one but the Bey&mdash;where the
money has been hidden away!  ..."
</p>

<p>
"Hidden money&mdash;and where!"  Sharp greed wakens in the
pale eyes.  They dig in the smouldering black ones as if
treasure lay behind them: "I who speak am Hamid Bey.  Now,
Jew&mdash;out with it!&mdash;where is the money?"
</p>

<p>
"I will tell&mdash;I will tell, but only to the Bey," moans the
voice between the clenched teeth.  "Send away thy people....
Fasten the door lest they creep back and overhear.  There was
a whole bag of English gold!  I brought it to buy the freedom
of the Nazrâni priest&mdash;and coveting the money, buried
it&mdash;where I will tell thee...."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Peki</i>!  Very good,&mdash;all right!"  The Bey turns upon his
men, and dismisses them with an injunction to keep well out
of earshot, then kicks-to the broken door and returns to the
side of the <i>anghareb</i>.
</p>

<p>
The fear of desire thwarted grips him now, for the face is
contorted in a ghastly grin, and the black eyes are rolling in
their bloody sockets.  He stoops over and shouts in the bloated
ear, "Wake, dog!  Tell now&mdash;or I call back the soldiers.  Tell
of the hidden gold! ..."
</p>

<p>
"I will tell! ..."  The mountainous body heaves, the flayed
muscles stand out on the huge arms like thick blue cordage....
"Stoop lower!  Bend thine ear close!  I buried&mdash;I buried
it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where? ..."  The thick yellow-pale ear approaches the
grinning teeth.  "Where didst thou bury it?  <i>Ai&mdash;y!</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
The beginning of a shriek of pain is choked in the Turk's
fat throat, even as the big, white teeth sink into a bulging
fold of it&mdash;between the ear and the collar.  Their owner growls
as a savage dog might do&mdash;and with an effort that rends the
tattered flesh, drags an arm from under the chain that binds
him down&mdash;and with a second wrench, releases the other....
</p>

<p>
Now both big hands are gripped round the Bey's throat,
and his pale eyes bulge, and his pasty face is blackening.  No
sound escapes his gaping mouth, from which the saliva
streams.  And the blood from the great artery, bitten through;
like a torrent of warm and sticky rain deluges the face and
breast of his enemy.
</p>

<p>
"I buried the gold," the voice croaks in the now discoloured
ear, "in Esther's tomb.  Dost thou hear me well, O Hamid?
But I have brought thee a gift instead&mdash;the gift that many
have had of thee.  Even Death at these hands of mine&mdash;murderer,
fornicator, lecher!  Another twist yet for thy fat
neck.  For Jacob! ... This for Esther!&mdash;this for Julian
Forbis! ... And this last of all for John Hazaël&mdash;who takes
the head of the dog! ..."
</p>

<p>
The strength is ebbing from the great hands....  The
fingers relax their hold upon the throat of the dead body....
Now with the head bent under it at a suggestive, ugly angle,
it drops with a dull, heavy thud, upon the blood-slimed floor.
</p>

<h3>
XIX
</h3>

<p>
The sun of a day in the second week of December, 1917,
rose on the last day of Ottoman dominion in the City that,
since fifteen hundred years before the Birth of the Saviour
at Bethlehem, has been, at regular intervals, the storm-centre
of the world.
</p>

<p>
Panic followed on the arrival of some disintegrated units of
a Turkish transport-column with the news that the British
occupied Hebron; that their Advance held the Railway, and
would soon be within sight.  "No lie," as ancient Fuller says,
for the London Division was at Lifta.
</p>

<p>
Hence general stampede ensued, and Turkish <i>postas</i> of
infantry, indifferent alike to the loaded whips and the curses of
their officers, shed packs, bandoliers and rifles, and fled
incontinent.  There was a running to and fro of Jewish and native
Syrian citizens.  Wives and daughters called to husbands and
sons, and brothers&mdash;long hidden in underground vaults, or
unsuspected attics, "The Turks are running!  Deliverance has
come! ..."
</p>

<p>
By two o'clock noon Turkish troops, mounted and afoot,
muddy, weary and thoroughly disgruntled,&mdash;Field batteries,
machine-gun companies, baggage-lorries and ambulances of the
Red Crescent&mdash;poured through the Jaffa Gate from the west
and south-west.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Gitmeya mejburûz</i>&mdash;we have to go!" the <i>postas</i> called to
wounded comrades leaning from the Hospital windows, and
the muddy torrent rolled through the streets of the Holy City,
and out at St. Stephen's Gate upon the eastern side.
</p>

<p>
Towards dark, the Governor Izzet Bey went to the
telegraph-office, discharged the staff of trembling Turks, smashed
the Morse instruments with a hammer, and leaving in charge
of the nervous Mayor a letter of surrender&mdash;borrowed the
Cape cart and team of an American resident, and left for
Jericho....  And by seven a.m. on the anniversary of the day
of the recapture of the Temple from Pagan Seleucids by Judas
Maccabæus in 165 B.C. the Ottoman inundation had drained
away into the sombre depths of the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
over the ancient Roman bridges of the Jordan&mdash;and cowed
and bullied citizens who had been beaten, dragooned and
plundered&mdash;were mustering courage to plunder in their
turn.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The eagles of the R.F.C. wheeled in the azure overhead,
but no pageantry of any kind marred the entry of the
Conqueror.
</p>

<p>
For years the gathering of more than three persons together
in one place had been punished by the Turkish police with fines,
imprisonment and beatings.  Now the Turk had been thrust
out, but Fear lingered still.  For, as the British
Commander-in-Chief&mdash;preceded by his <i>aides</i> and Staff, and accompanied
by distinguished representatives of the Allied Nations,&mdash;passed
through the Jaffa Gate on foot, the huge concourse of pale
and hollow-eyed residents and townsfolk mustered on the roofs
and gathered in the streets&mdash;witnessed the thing almost in
silence.  Dumb, for the most part, pallid, immobile, like
people carved of stone.  Only, when from the Gateway before
the Tower whose foundations were laid by David&mdash;and whose
walls were reared by Suleiman the Magnificent&mdash;the Proclamation
of Religious Freedom was read in the Four Languages,
a sob like the breaking of a great wave broke from innumerable
breasts, and eyes that had been dry for years were wet with
tears at last....
</p>

<p>
The work was done.  By strategical pressure, without the
graze of a bullet on her sacred walls, the Holy City had
surrendered.  He did not linger after the reading of the
Proclamation.  He received in the square behind the Citadel the
civil and religious notables of the City&mdash;the Mayor of Jerusalem,
the Shaykhs in charge of the Mosque of Omar and Aksa,
the Rabbis of the Spanish, German and Syrian Synagogues,
the Fathers Representative of the Syrian, Greek, Abyssinian,
Armenian and Latin Catholic Churches (their Patriarchs
having by the Turks been forcibly deported)&mdash;the Anglican
Bishop, the American Episcopalian&mdash;and Dissenting Ministers....
</p>

<p>
The brief ceremony over, he passed away as he had come,
with his following, through the Gate of Jaffa; his soldierly
tread sounding over the deep-buried threshold crossed in past
ages by the war-horses of David, the chariot-wheels of
Solomon and Nebuchadnezzar&mdash;the slave-borne litters of the
Pharaohs, the tyrant-Kings of old Assyria&mdash;as by the
golden-studded white bull's hide sandals of Alexander of Macedon,
and from thenceonward how many conquerors more....
</p>

<p>
Freedom and Peace came to the War-ridden City of the
Prince of Peace with the Wire Road and the Pipe-Line.  To a
mixed and breathlessly-waiting queue of strangely-variegated
nationalities, (per medium of a standpipe, an A.S.C Sergeant
and a turn-tap) the Nile waters&mdash;cool and pure, if strongly
flavoured with chlorine, were dispensed, and sent flowing
through Jerusalem....  Fulfilling the ancient Egyptian prophecy,
that when the waters of the Nile should flow into
Palestine&mdash;there should arise in the West a prophet, one Al-Nebi,
who should capture the Holy City that sits on three limestone
hilltops of old Judæa&mdash;and deliver the land from the loathed
dominion of the Turk.
</p>

<p>
This having yet to be done, he went away to do it! perhaps
with a passing smile at the breach in the City Wall made for
the theatrical entry of the German No-Emperor in 1898.  His
was the motive power behind the long lines of moving men
toiling northward under their packs through the mud of Judæa,
the long trains of groaning baggage- and water-camels, the
processions of waggons drawn by complaining mules, the
caterpillar-wheeled lorries, carrying tons upon tons of food and
ammunition, the Staff cars carrying red-tabbed officers swiftly
from point to point....
</p>

<p>
He was consolidating his positions on the Jerusalem-Shechem
Road, and thrusting his cavalry over the Jordan, while a
Sergeant and file of Military Police combed Alexandria for a
defaulting London Territorial, Acting Sergeant John Hazel, of
the Fenchurch Street Regiment,&mdash;who had failed to return to
the Front at the end of the fortnight's leave.  He was moving
on Bethlehem, while the defaulter lay delirious on a string-bed,
swathed in sheets of wet boracic wadding&mdash;in the house of
a Jew of Shechem.  One Benjamin Sebastia, a small dealer in
precious stones, and a loyal friend to Esther Hazaël&mdash;otherwise
known to readers of this tale as the Mother of Ugliness.
</p>

<p>
The cellar in Benjamin Sebastia's house had often served
as a hiding-place, being clean and dry and fairly free from
stinks.  Through its thick stone walls no curious ear could
catch the sick man's ravings&mdash;when he called on certain Big
Old Men to come to the rescue&mdash;or poured mad love-words in
the imaginary ear of a woman named Katharine....
</p>

<p>
It seemed, he thought, poor crazed and suffering wretch! that
he had kept back from a man named Yaill a certain letter
and, carrying out a rescue by his own unaided hand, had
claimed reward of this service from the aforesaid Katharine.
Through the long days and the longer nights, when the scourge
of self-reproach for this imaginary baseness bit deep into the
tortured soul housed in the tortured body, the woman who
sat beside him never once failed to answer:
</p>

<p>
"But, John Hazaël, my cousin, thou didst not do the thing!"
</p>

<p>
"Did I not? ... Is that true?" he would ask her over and
over.  "But I wished to, I desired to...."
</p>

<p>
"And desiring, thou didst resist."
</p>

<p>
"That is good&mdash;if it be true...."
</p>

<p>
"It is true.  Does Esther ever lie to thee?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" he would groan, lying there in his helplessness.  "Now
tell me again how I was found, and brought to this place?"
</p>

<p>
"When&mdash;" (she would lay fresh pieces of soaked lint on the
huge, swollen body, or ease the perpetual, torturing thirst
with some cool, refreshing drink.) "When I ran away from
Kir Saba, back to Shechem, I found&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That I," there is a smile on the shapeless mouth&mdash;"that I
had kept my word to thee, and taken the head of the dog!  I
think the people did not weep? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  It was as the passing of a plague&mdash;the lifting of a
shadow&mdash;and the soldiers who had guarded the Wired Place
openly rejoiced.  Many being set down for beating, and fines,
and so forth&mdash;because of neglect in the matter of keeping watch,
on the night of the Sidi's escape...."
</p>

<p>
"They got good rest that night, I think? ..."
</p>

<p>
"So good," she gives her little rustling laugh, "that all of
them swear they were bewitched, or that some friend of the
Sidi's drugged the rations sent from the Barracks&mdash;so that
they slept like the Seven, and waked to find him gone.  So
they were glad the Bey was dead....  Especially the <i>sabtiehs</i>
of his command were glad, for their old <i>bimbashi</i> is now
Commandant&mdash;and his name hath favour among them&mdash;he being a
merciful man."
</p>

<p>
"A merciful Turk is a rare bird," the formless mouth says
grimly.  "And so&mdash;no suspicion attaching to her name&mdash;or
thine&mdash;the Dervish remaining silent&mdash;thou didst bribe the
Gipsy woman of the Bazâr to go with thee to the hut in the
Wired Place, and take my body away...."
</p>

<p>
"Paying a price to the soldiers in the name of certain Jewish
townsfolk, who&mdash;it being known among them that thou wert
a Jew!&mdash;would have buried thee decently.  And when&mdash;thinking
thee a corpse&mdash;I leaned over thee to cut away the knotted
rag that hid the Signet of Hazaël, from the cord by which thou
hadst hung it round thy neck&mdash;I saw, by the Mercy of the Most
High!&mdash;that thou wert still breathing.  And even as I myself
was brought into this place of hiding, I and Inaini the Gipsy,
carried thee here that night....  Some help I gave in the
sickness of her child, she hath never forgotten.  May the
Most High reward her! ... What had we done without her
strong arms to lift thee, and her poultices of healing herbs....
Now sleep, for thou hast talked enough!  See how thy poor
heart shakes thee! ..."
</p>

<p>
"One question more...."  The puffy lips are blue, and he
labours in his breathing: "When shall I be able to stand again
on these elephant's feet of mine? ..."
</p>

<p>
She swallows her tears and answers:
</p>

<p>
"Soon, it may be....  Only be content, only wait a little
longer!"
</p>

<p>
And propped on high-piled pillows, he promises obediently,
looking down his long misshapen bulk at his huge distorted
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Very well!  I will wait a little longer.  Thou hast money
to meet the charges?"
</p>

<p>
"Plenty as yet, my cousin&mdash;without touching the sum that
was in the belt thou gavest me to keep.  Tell me one thing....
If thou couldst be moved&mdash;whither wouldst thou be carried,
we escaping under cover of night from this unhappy
place? ..."
</p>

<p>
"To somewhere near Jerusalem," says the thick voice, feebly.
</p>

<p>
"To Jerusalem? ..."
</p>

<p>
She starts and looks at him, but the black eyes under their
calloused lids are fixed upon the opposite wall.
</p>

<p>
"I said to somewhere near there.  I may not go to the City
until I get a message from One who is my Friend...."
</p>

<p>
"He has come there with the British since the Turks were
driven out of the City? ..."
</p>

<p>
The black eyes slowly move to meet hers.  He shakes his
scarred head:
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  He has been waiting there for long&mdash;a very long
time....  But when I get a Sign from Him, then I must go
up...."
</p>

<p>
"There is some great reason compelling thee?"
</p>

<p>
"There is something waiting for me at Jerusalem.  I was told
it that night in the wooden hut.  Tell me"&mdash;the voice is like
a child's&mdash;"if I cannot move, how shall I obey the Sign when
it comes to me? ..."
</p>

<p>
She soothes him, thinking that his pain and weakness make
him wander.
</p>

<p>
"Leave all to me.  To-morrow may find thee strong.  Only
rest and sleep now! ..."
</p>

<p>
And he sleeps, with heavy broken breaths of utter exhaustion
and weariness.
</p>

XX
</h3>

<p>
He is kept concealed&mdash;for though Turkish vigilance is somewhat
relaxed in Shechem&mdash;there would be short shrift for the
slayer of Hamid, were he known to be living still.  Perhaps
it may be because of this, that though his wounds slowly
heal, John grows no stronger.  A Jewish surgeon, related to
Benjamin Sebastia, who is brought by stealth to see the patient,
examines him, and goes away, shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
"Too late!  It would always have been too late, however
soon you had called me," he says to Sebastia as he takes his
leave.  "The man must have had a giant's strength to live
through such an ordeal.  My brother was a powerful man, yet
he died under the rods....  Heart a wreck! ... Lungs....
Pff! ... May die at any moment! ... <i>Shalôm!</i>  To the
Downfall of the Ottoman Power, and the Restoration of
Jewry!" and he drains his glass of Palestine Tokay and refuses
his fee, and goes.  And his verdict is cautiously broken to John
Hazel, who comforts weeping Esther, declaring the opinion of
a Hebrew in a <i>kaftan</i> and fur hat and side-curls, with a Paris
Diploma&mdash;not worth a British damn!  He is even a shade
better next day, as though in sheer defiance of the owner of the
Paris Diploma and the side-curls and <i>kaftan</i>....
</p>

<p>
He has known how the months change by the flowers that
Esther brings him, and others that Inaini, smiling, produces
from the folds of her veil.  Great clusters of crimson anemones,
crocuses, purple and white; grape hyacinths, tulips and
daffodils&mdash;and it is March.  More anemones of varied, jewel-bright
colours, purple, pink, and crimson; jonquils, and white and
yellow Marguerites.  Yellow, blue and lilac lupins&mdash;narcissus
and violets, iris and cyclamen&mdash;and wealthy April's here....
He likes the anemones and looks at them for hours, drowsily
turning them in his well-nigh helpless hands....  For the
creamy ones are like Katherine's skin, and the rose-red are her
blushes, and the brown-gold are&mdash;or so he thinks&mdash;the colour
of her eyes....  The rows of velvety hairs that fringe the
centre of the corolla are black as her eye-lashes&mdash;black as her
hair....  But the scent of violets brings her back, complete
in her sweet womanliness, with the Chapel and Kerr's Arbour
for a background to it all....
</p>

<p>
Now come great sheaves of lilies, phlox and gladioli, and
it is May, the Month of the Rose.  Masses of perfume, colour
and fragrance are brought to the cellar in the jeweller's
back-yard.  And John plays with them, or stares at the whitewashed
wall, or listens as Esther reads to him from a copy of the
Jewish Scriptures, a volume belonging to their host, printed in
Hebrew and Arabic.  The Messianic Prophecies are what he
hears most gladly, and oftenest asks for.  One day as she
closes the Book at the end of a passage from Isaiah:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>And He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised
for our iniquities, and the chastisement of our peace was upon
Him, and by His stripes we are healed.</i>"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That&mdash;that is why it was said to me that night!&mdash;" she hears
the slow voice whisper: "'Thou hast suffered for obedience to
thy father's fathers, and for the keeping of the Oath, and for
the love of one woman.  But I, that I might do the Will of My
Father&mdash;and thy Father&mdash;and for the love of all mankind.'"
</p>

<p>
"O my Cousin!"  Habitually now, the soft Arabic speech
flows to and fro between them, "Who was it said those words
to thee? ..."
</p>

<p>
"It was on the night&mdash;" the scarred head turns on the
high-propped pillow&mdash;"the night after the beating.  My hands and
feet were torture, and I had a great thirst.  And there came a
light on the wall of the hut, and Somebody spoke to me, and
the blood cleared from my eyes, and I saw Him then...."
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;who was He?"  She draws an awed breath.
</p>

<p>
"He said He was my Friend&mdash;and I believed Him.  You
could not see Him as I did&mdash;and doubt any more.  Dost thou
recall the fresco in the tomb on Ebal?  It is not like&mdash;how
could it be His likeness?  But the man who made it had seen
Him in a Vision, and caught the faintest shadow of His look."
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;do not understand...."
</p>

<p>
"It does not matter.  But that is why I was so sure I should
not die just then....  I cannot yet enter Jerusalem, for there
is blood upon my hands that has been shed in vengeance&mdash;but,
I am to wait near the City until I get the Sign...."
</p>

<p>
"Dearest, art thou quite sure&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt not, being certain.  Now, having breath enough&mdash;I
would speak of other things.  When I am dead, thou wilt write
and tell the things to my mother&mdash;and go to thine own mother
at Alexandria.  She is wealthy and so art thou, thou dost
need no provision, so the Fortune of Eli Hazaël, our
grandfather, will go to build and endow the Hebrew University."
</p>

<p>
"But thy brother, Maurice, what of him?"
</p>

<p>
"It is borne in on me," the black eyes are momentarily
dimmed, "that Maurice is dead.  I have felt it for a long time.
My mother must be sorely grieved.  He was her dearest son."
</p>

<p>
"Art thou not dear to her also?" Esther asks sadly.
</p>

<p>
"She will sorrow for me too&mdash;but not as she does for Maurice.
And she has a good friend, an old flame,&mdash;a Dutchman in
the City, Herman Van Ost his name is&mdash;and she will marry
him now.  She would have married him years ago, but Maurice
did not wish it.  There is another task for thee yet, my Sweet.
Dost thou shrink from it, Little One?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay.  For thou art Hazaël, and the Head of our House.
Surely I will obey thee.  Have thou no doubt of me! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Kind One! ... Brave One!  Little Judith in Israel!&mdash;  Surely
thou wilt be rewarded for thy courage and thy faith.
Listen now! ... When I who am the littlest and least of all
the Hazaëls shall be gathered to our fathers&mdash;thou shalt seek
out Katharine Forbis&mdash;wherever thou shalt hear of her&mdash;and
carry word from me."  The voice deepens and grows strong:
"Say&mdash;there is no longer an Hazaël left of the male line, to
guard the Ashes.  The Oath is fulfilled&mdash;the Debt is paid!
Katharine and her children&mdash;and theirs following them&mdash;must
take upon them to be Guardians of the Shrine."
</p>

<p>
"What Oath was it?"
</p>

<p>
"The Oath made sixteen hundred years ago and more, by
Hazaël Aben Hazaël.  Remember!&mdash;she is to take the Urn
back to Kerr's Arbour, and house it under the altar in the
Chapel there....  And her children will reverence it&mdash;knowing
its sacredness.  Perhaps," the black eyes are shining now
with a light that is soft and gentle, "perhaps there will be a
little boy&mdash;with eyes like his mother's&mdash;who will ask for the
story oftener and love it more than the
others&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;his name will be John ..."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, dearest!&mdash;dearest! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Do not cry.  All this when I have departed....  Till then
I would be forgotten by all I used to know."
</p>

<p>
"Then thou wilt say I have done right when I tell thee that
some two months back&mdash;when thou wert very feeble&mdash;diligent
search was made for thee.  Even under the eyes of the Turks
and Germans&mdash;a man whom thou knowest ventured into this
place."
</p>

<p>
"One whom I know! ..."  The black eyes flash, the scarred
head turns towards her on the pillow: "Is his name Yaill?"
</p>

<p>
"His name is Colonel Edward Yaill, though sometimes he
calls himself the Emir Fadl Anga.  He was garbed as a Moghrabi
sugar-merchant&mdash;but I knew his eyes again.  So I sought
him out, and guessing at thy pleasure in the matter, I told
him thou couldst not be moved&mdash;and he went away from
here."
</p>

<p>
"It is well.  Now I talk no more, sweetheart, for breath is
hard to come by.  Do one thing that I ask before the daylight
goes.  Take off thy veil, little Judith, and let me see thee plainly.
For once!  I will not ask again, if my asking hurt thee so!"
</p>

<p>
She falters a refusal, then yields at his entreaty.
</p>

<p>
"Shut thine eyes for a little moment, and open when I
call...."
</p>

<p>
He shuts his eyes and opens them, to see Esther sitting at the
bed-foot....  A figure girlish in its youth fulness, pathetic
in its slender fragility, and veilless, save for the tresses of
her rich black silken hair.  She parts the hair with two little
brown hands, then throws it back on either side, revealing the
face it has covered&mdash;and a sob catches in the man's throat, and
his eyes are wet with tears....
</p>

<p>
For that side of Esther's face that is never shown is beautiful,
strangely beautiful.  The great dark eye under the arched
black eyebrow, the little aquiline nose, with proud curved
nostrils, the delicate mouth, the rounded chin, are of purest Hebrew
type.  She bears his scrutiny awhile, then lifts the discarded
covering, adjusts it with quick, slender hands&mdash;and is Ummshni
once again.
</p>

<p>
"Will that do?  Hast thou looked enough?" she asks with a
touch of sharp regret for her lost heritage of Beauty.
</p>

<p>
"I have looked....  And I have seen&mdash;as I knew I should!"
says John placidly, "that thy face, my little Esther&mdash;is lovely
as thy soul.  Now I will rest, for I am done.  Perhaps I shall
walk to-morrow...."
</p>

<p>
Comes the month of June, with ardent suns, and July with
skies of fire.  Esther reads to John in another Book&mdash;a copy
of the Syriac Gospels picked up on a stall in the Bazâr&mdash;of
One Whose teachings she has been reared to hold as rank
blasphemy.  But her Hazaël has commanded it, and she obeys
Hazaël, and reads of Him Who raised the dead to life, and
opened the eyes of those born blind, and made the lame to
walk.  Here in this land of Palestine nearly two thousand
years ago.  But time goes on and this lame man does not
walk yet....
</p>

<p>
It is October, the month of Asphodel, and Shechem is swept
clean of Germans and Turks, as the brown line moves up
north.  The great Commander-in-Chief of the E.E.F. has
carried out his leopard-pounce on Nazareth,&mdash;whence Von Sanders
and his Headquarters Staff have fled&mdash;Tiberias and Amman
have been occupied by British Forces, and the stronghold of
Turkish Power at Damascus has fallen, before the colossal,
tottering bulk can balance on its feet.
</p>

<p>
No available garments of European make can be adapted to
John's hugeness.  Esther and the jewel-dealer's wife are in
despair, then hit upon a brilliant idea.  A vast pair of Turkish
drawers of yellow and white striped-cotton are tucked into
the baggy tops of immense soft yellow boots.  Over an Arab
<i>jubba</i> of white cotton material goes a loose-sleeved Arab
over-robe of brown camel-hair.  They cover him with a black felt
<i>tarbûsh</i>, and a white silk <i>kuffiyeh</i> bound with a scarlet
head-rope, and swathe him in the voluminous folds of a
primrose-coloured <i>jerd</i>.  Now, with the beard that he has grown in
captivity at Shechem, the mother at home in London would
not know her son again.
</p>

<p>
The German Commander with his merry men departed in
haste for Aleppo when the huge khaki torrent rolled upon
Samaria from the South....  The Turks of the garrison
escaped over Jordan, the batteries on the flank of Ebal were taken
by the British, and the Patriarchs and other notables deported
from the Holy City are chartering vehicles to take them back
again.
</p>

<p>
Some of these are quaint enough.  To witness, the ancient
travelling-landau, piled with luggage of a heterogeneous
description, packed with Armenian Fathers, and drawn by a tall
camel and a small, rebellious mule.  But the hooded
bath-pony-chair of largest size, a venerable derelict of British make
left by some wealthy traveller years ago to moulder in the
courtyard of a Shechem hotel, to which a diminutive
red-tasselled donkey has been harnessed, and in which is seated a
prodigiously obese and bushy-bearded Arab, possibly takes the
palm....
</p>

<p>
Three women run beside the chair, drawn by the small
donkey driven by an Arab urchin with a sharpened palm-wood
stick.  As the chair rolls through the east gate, and moves in
the rolling dust-cloud with a column of other vehicles, past the
Wired Place and the Mohammedan Tombs, the little donkey
stops.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Shalôm, Sidi</i>!  Health and recovery be thine&mdash;and Happiness
with the Blessing!" says the wife of the jewel-dealer,
bidding John Hazel farewell.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, O woman of gentle heart....  Remember me to
thy husband.  And farewell, kind Inaini....  Sometimes
remember us! ..."
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, my lord....  My lord will not soon forget Shechem!"
says Inaini, with a flash of brilliant eyes and teeth from
between her flowered veils....
</p>

<p>
"Nor thee.  May the Most High reward thee for all thy
charity! ..."
</p>

<p>
"It was nothing!" says the woman, almost sullenly, but John
can hear her sob....
</p>

<p>
"O my friend!  O my sister!  Farewell, good-bye!  Little
Mother of Ugliness, my heart is sore to part! ..."
</p>

<p>
The jewel-dealer's wife hugs the little white-robed figure.
Esther embraces her, and then Inaini&mdash;and the honest woman
and the courtesan go away together, both red-eyed with weeping
behind their shrouding veils.  And the big bath chair drawn
by the little donkey&mdash;with the huge Arab in it and the little
woman and the native boy running beside it&mdash;is lost in the
stream of traffic on the Jerusalem-Shechem Road.
</p>

<p>
It is a day of dust and sun, and the big man in the bath
chair drawn by the little donkey is as feeble as he is heavy,
and unfitted to bear fatigue.  It is night by the time they have
left the plain, and the road climbs amongst the hills, that are
ridged and furrowed with the traces of War, as the face that
is shaded by the white <i>jerd</i>, and the body that the sick heart's
throbbing shakes, and the man's misshapen hands and feet are
scarred by the Turkish <i>asayisi</i>....
</p>

<p>
Sunset flames over the Western Sea and all the land is rosy-dyed
when at last he looks on the ancient City, the bourne of
his desires.  Set between east and west upon three hills, of
which the lesser, Ophel, has vanished&mdash;the limestone spurs
of Sion and Moriah upholding her, she turns her back upon
the ocean plain and the mild damp airs that blow from it, to
fill her lungs with the burning winds and dust-storms of the
Wilderness&mdash;where the Son of God and Saviour of mankind
was tempted of Satan, and Jordan's yellow waters flow
towards the abyss of the Dead Sea.
</p>

<p>
They go no farther that night, for the sick man cannot bear
it, but hire two rooms, almost clean, and newly whitewashed,
at the Khân of a little mud-built Mohammedan village that sits
on a hill beside the road.
</p>

<p>
The left wing of the London Division were entrenched here
before the Occupation, and the Advance that moved them
north....  The whitewash of the Khân of Shafât has familiar
names scribbled upon it, attached to caustic comments on the
price of native eggs, dates, cheese, oranges and olives, as
compared with their quality and their size.
</p>

<p>
And here the little party stay.  For the big man in the
bath chair can travel no farther.  Many days pass and he can
move again; and the little donkey is harnessed to the chair by
its tasselled traces, and the Arab boy with the palm-stick, and
the little veiled woman run by it&mdash;and the queer <i>cortége</i> halts
by and by where the broad dusty track that leads south and a
shade west to the Damascus Gate, forks off on the left to the
less broad, better-kept carriage way that&mdash;following the line of
the mountain-ridge, leads&mdash;south and a trifle east&mdash;to the
Mount of Olives, passing the Tombs of the Kings.
</p>

<p>
In the shadow of the south wall of the royal enclosure, the
sick man signifies his wish to halt.  All day he lingers there,
content, and for the greater part in silence; shares with his
meek nurse and the Arab boy such food as they have with
them&mdash;and when the short dusk heralds Dark, is loth to leave
the spot.  Next day they are there again&mdash;and the next day
and the next.  It is here, he signifies to his patient nurse, that
the Message he waits will reach him&mdash;and content that Hazaël
should be content, she knows no other will.

<p>
Meanwhile, the period of stagnation past, the current of life
begins to flow within and around Jerusalem.  In the house of
an English Protestant Missionary Society without the walls,
a Division has its Headquarters.  At the Sign of the Red
Triangle, guides may be obtained for the reverent conduct of
soldier-visitors to the Holy Places.  Here also photographs
for the folks at home, with lightning hair-cuts and shaves, can
be supplied with light refreshments.  Signboards along the
Jaffa Road invite Crusaders from the Land of the Ifrangi to
partake at their own peril of sweets, ices and cakes....  And
a Divisional Theatre flourishes in a tin-roofed shed, outside
the Gate of Jaffa, and a Cinema established in a ramshackle
booth is nightly packed to the walls.
</p>

<p>
Though the trenches and gun-emplacements on the Mount
of Olives and Mount Scopas yet speak of War, there are local
tennis-parties on badly neglected lawns, and even small dances
to the accompaniment of the gramophone.  The donkey-boys
and Cook's tourists are no more....  But there are Military
Races and Military Sports; and divers favourites, human and
equine, are duly backed by the men of the Expeditionary
Army....
</p>

<p>
Within the City English soldiers guard the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre and Mohammedans the Haram.  The depot of
the A.S.C. is lodged in the courtyard of a Jewish School.
</p>

<p>
English Military Nursing Sisters are housed in the Abyssinian
Patriarch's palace&mdash;the French Convent where the Turkish
Army Officers were, now shelters French soldiers&mdash;though
the Turkish Crescent and Star have not yet been obliterated
from the Jaffa Gate; and the Arab police, in black sheepskin
caps and dark blue drill uniforms, keep order as they used
to under the Turkish <i>régime</i>....
</p>

<p>
Though the solemn boom of heavy guns still wakens all
the echoes of the Hills of Judæa, though Turkish batteries
and Turkish troops move in the neighbourhood of Jericho, and
British motor-launches churn the waters of the Dead Sea, the
Holy City is wakening from her torpor of years....
Kinder-gartens and boys' and girls' schools, Christian and Jewish,
Homes and Orphanages&mdash;the Teacher's University, the
Missionary Colleges, and the seminaries supervised by Catholic
Religious&mdash;revive like the withered blossoms of the so-called
Jericho Rose....
</p>

<p>
The Clothes-Market near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,&mdash;where
skin affections and fleas could be purchased at exorbitant
prices&mdash;re-opens.  In the labyrinth of <i>bâzârs</i> under the
shadowy arcades, the Jew and Arab pedlars set up their stalls
of rosaries and medals, gaudy religious pictures, and common
household wares.  Sleek-haired Levantines and Syrians behind
counters of modern shops, offer antiques and souvenirs in
mother o' pearl and olive-wood; ostrich feathers, roses of
Jericho, Syriac Gospels and Rolls of the Law.  German stores
miraculously become Dutch, offer for sale liqueurs, cigars,
<i>sauer-kraut</i> in barrels, tinned sausage, pickles and chocolates.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And the People who Wait for Signs have come out of their
various hiding-places.  The haggard man who carries a heavy
wooden Cross and wears a plaited Crown of Thorns, pants
under his heavy burden from station to station along the
Sorrowful Way....  And the other, long haired and wearing
robes of white, waits again near the Jaffa Gate, carrying his
brightly-polished lamp, well trimmed and filled with oil.  He
says he is one of the Virgins waiting for the Coming of the
Bridegroom....  And again, there is another, a handsome,
martial figure, in the panoply of a Knight of Malta, folded in a
cross-embroidered mantle, girt with a Crusader's sword....
</p>

<p>
Who knows what compact these and many more have made
with One Whom they acknowledge Master.  They are content,
for their belief in Him, to be despised as fools.  Calm,
reasonable Christians shudder at, or ignore, while the Children of
Islam respect them.  To their number another is added with
the passage of the days....
</p>

<p>
December draws to its end again.  Tea-parties and concerts
are given, and the Representatives of the Three Great Faiths
may be said to fraternise.  The Red Cross and the Society of
St. John of Jerusalem unite in splendid efforts for the good
of War-ridden Humanity.  The olives are grey-green, and the
palms are yellowing, and the first pale mist of almond-bloom
pinkens on the hillsides, above the hedges of tamarisk&mdash;and
Christmas Eve is here....
</p>

<p>
The portly Arab in the bath-chair drawn by the tiny donkey
sits in his accustomed place, from which fierce gales and heavy
Winter rains alone may drive him, in the shelter of the south
wall of the Enclosure of the Tombs of the Kings....
</p>

<p>
Two chaplains of the E.E.F. go by in their cross-badged
khaki; accompanied by an elderly Armenian in flowing black
<i>kaftan</i> and high square head-dress.
</p>

<p>
"There's the New Crank," says an Oxford voice.  "And the
little Syrian woman, and the bath chair and the donkey-boy&mdash;and
the donkey possibly&mdash;all waiting as usual for the Sign
that doesn't come!"
</p>

<p>
"'The Sign.'  What Sign? ..."
</p>

<p>
The second khaki chaplain looks with interest at the Arab.
The strong south wind has blown back the folds of his ample
head-covering, and it is plainly seen what kind of man the
drapery has concealed.  His huge ears, swollen beyond all
shape, hang down on the bulgy, turgid flesh of the neck-folds,
his huge hooked nose, and long but shapeless upper-lip
dominate an extraordinary acreage of countenance that is ridged
and knobbed and crumpled like a new-dug potato-field.  And
his great hands and gigantic arms, wherever these are
visible, present the same appearance, to the chaplain's
curious eye.
</p>

<p>
"Would that be some obscure form of elephantiasis, do
you think, now?" he asks the Armenian ecclesiastic who walks
by his side.
</p>

<p>
"It is not disease of any kind," the Armenian answers in
English.  "The man has been beaten&mdash;nearly to death, and has
lived&mdash;that is all! ... Many of my friends, condemned to the
severest punishment of the Turkish <i>asâyisi</i>, have died under
the infliction&mdash;as this man was meant to do...."
</p>

<p>
"Speak lower!"  It is the second chaplain in khaki who is
speaking.  "That Arab understands you....  I saw it in his
eyes...."
</p>

<p>
"Not he!" the first speaker returns.  "He's an Arab pure and
simple&mdash;and some of the Tommies have dubbed him 'The Father
of Buffaloes.'  The little woman with him has a
nickname&mdash;somebody told me....  "<i>Sabâh-el-kheir</i>, Daddy Buffalo....
<i>Khud</i>!&mdash;and good luck to you! ..."
</p>

<p>
And a couple of Turkish <i>beshliks</i> clink into the Arab's lap.
</p>

<p>
"Thy day be happy and blessed!" says a deep bass voice in
answer.  The three pedestrians pass on, and the beshliks fall
amongst the straw in the bottom of the bath-chair.  Unseen
save by the sharp glance of the Arab donkey-boy, who squats
in the shadow of the wall of the Enclosure, playing, with lines
scratched upon the smooth limestone, a game that is scored
upon the walls and flags of old Pompeii, as upon the recently
excavated guard-room of the Herodian Mercenaries, eighteen
feet under the level of the Sorrowful Way.  A brace of coppers
thrown to a sick man sitting by the wayside are surely given
in charity.  Yet when the sick one dies, the Fund amassed to
build and endow the Hebrew University (the foundations of
which are being even now blasted in the rock of Mount Scopas)
will be enriched by a legacy of three hundred and eighty
thousand pounds....
</p>

<p>
"What does it matter, Essie?  Sweet One, why dost thou
tremble?  Surely the gift was kindly meant!"
</p>

<p>
The speaker thinks that his companion has been hurt by the
bestowal of the coins.  But she has not even seen the gift made,
or heard the giver's words....
</p>

<p>
A moment since, a grey Staff car, driven by a soldier-chauffeur
with the Great Headquarters' brassard&mdash;coming from the
direction of the station beyond the Montefiore Hospice, by the
road that skirts the City wall, to debouch upon the Road of the
Damascus Gate&mdash;has passed by the Tombs of the Kings.
Driven at speed, it has flashed by, carrying strangers with it.
But one face was not strange....  One voice; borne on the
wind that blows from Samaria, has echoed in the ears of
Esther-Ummshni, bringing memories that brim the heart....
</p>

<p>
"I did not hear....  I thought I saw....  What is it, what
is it, Mabruk?"
</p>

<p>
For the Arab boy has run down the road to meet a messenger
from the Khân.
</p>

<p>
"What says he? ..." asks the deep, slow voice.
</p>

<p>
"He says&mdash;Mabruk says&mdash;" Esther commences, shaking like
a wind-blown reed of the Jordan behind her shrouding veils:
"that strangers are at Shafât.  He says&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O Shaykh!&mdash;"  Mabruk, a lanky crow-necked youngster,
son of the Mohammedan landlord of the Shafât Khân, importantly
steps forwards: "Great ones have arrived at my father's
Khân.  Two lords of the Inglizi, and a lady, tall and beautiful.
They have sent me in the horseless carriage to bring back thee
and the Sitti.  This letter also they have sent thee by thy
servant's hands.&mdash;Behold! ..."
</p>

<p>
Mabrûk lifts the note to his eyes and forehead, and hands it
over.  A folded sheet of paper, sealed with an impression of
a well-known onyx signet, and scrawled with some hastily
pencilled lines in a beloved hand:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I am here, at the Khân at Shafât, with my brother and
husband.  Do not be angry that we have come!  Your aunt is
with us.  Tell your Cousin Esther, whom I long to see and
thank for my dear Julian, but not as I'm longing to see and
thank you!  Alone, dear, dear John!&mdash;because I'm jealous of
the others.  Your first word&mdash;your first look have got to be for
me.  Come back in the car or send it back to fetch&mdash;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  Your loving, grateful<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KATHARINE YAILL."<br>
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0422"></a></p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
Married.  For a long time John has felt that she was married.
Well, well, it was to be.  His sovereign lady, his dear Princess,
a wife, and soon, perhaps, a mother.  God bless her and her
husband.  He is glad, glad, because of their happiness....
Holding the pencilled scrawl with the seal of the Hercules, his
shapeless hand drops heavily back upon his knees.
</p>

<p>
"O John, my Cousin, answer me!"&mdash;Esther is eagerly
speaking&mdash;"The Sign that thou hast waited for so long, was it not
this? ..."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Sweet!"  He shakes his head.  "This is a token from
a friend beloved, but not the Sign I look for....  Now undo
the Ring of Hazaël from the cord about my neck.  Carry it to
her at the Khân where she waits with her brother.  Render
it back to them both from me.  Giving with the Ring, the
Message I have taught thee!&mdash;I need not to repeat the words,
they are written in thy heart...."
</p>

<p>
"But, dearest one&mdash;it was a message from the Dead, and
thou art yet living...."
</p>

<p>
She looks anxiously in the speaker's face.  Save that the
black eyes have a strange glaze, and the puffed lips are
lead-colour&mdash;and the beating of his damaged heart shakes the
flowing draperies that cover him&mdash;there is nothing to rouse her
fears.
</p>

<p>
"Take Katharine," there is a clang of masterful authority in
the deep voice, "take Katharine the Message&mdash;from the departing
Guardian of the Ashes.  Return in an hour.  Leave the
child here to sit by me.  One thing remains!&mdash;"  He calls her
back as she is turning meekly to obey him: "Kiss me, my
Little Cousin, before thou dost depart."
</p>

<p>
She goes, and presently the hoot of a car testifies to her
departure....  It nears the hour of sunset on this Vigil of
the Nativity.  There was a tang of frost early in the morning.
But the rosy air is warm and still, the sky serenely splendid,
the orange-breasted blackbirds pipe and trill, and clouds of
little ash-coloured, grasshopper-like insects rise at the brush
of footsteps through the short dun-coloured grass....
</p>

<p>
He sits there for a long time or a short time, he is not
certain.  To the soul upon the edge of Timelessness, many hours
are as one....  The tiny donkey, hobbled, grazes at a little
distance.  The Arab child who drives the beast, plays the
game that the soldiers of the Roman Guard played in the days
of Herod, and then, grown weary, steals off to play
elsewhere....
</p>

<p>
The sick man dozes heavily now, with jaw a little fallen,
and black eyes that show glazed and dim between their parted
lids....  The breaths that shake the puffed lips come slower
and fainter.  The Arab <i>jerd</i> that swathes him ceases to tremble
with the irregular beating of his heart....
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, his eyes stare wide and a strange cold thrill goes
through him.  He has been touched....  By whose hand? ... No
messenger stands near....  Can it be that so strange
a shock heralds the Sign that he has waited? ...
</p>

<p>
Midnight!&mdash;yet when he closed his eyes it was not yet sunset,
the blind muezzin of the Mosque of the Throne of Solomon
had not given the Call to Prayer....  And now, the Hosts of
Heaven blaze from zenith to horizon.  The full Moon stands
over Bethlehem and the flood of radiant pale light makes
Jerusalem a silver city, inlaid with jet and ebony....
</p>

<p>
Solemn black clouds heap over Moab.  The Valley of the
Kedron and the Vale of Our Lady Mary are swallowed in a
gulf of shade.  But Olivet is glorious in the brilliance that
pours down on her, making a prone black giant under every
lonely cypress, and a black cat crouching under every bush and
stone.
</p>

<p>
Bells ring from all the convents, and churches in Jerusalem.
All over Palestine bells ring for Christmas Day.  From
Bethlehem where He was born, comes the sound of joyful chiming.
On the north wind the sound of bells is brought from Nazareth....
</p>

<p>
"Peace on earth!" ... John Hazel stands and listens, as
from north, east, west and south the bells of Christmas ring....
A great cry breaks from him, of wild despair and
anguish:
</p>

<p>
"O Christ, there is no peace for me while yet Thou art
withholden.  O Shepherd of all broken hearts! send me Thy
promised Sign!  Speak to me at least, you Big Old Men," he cries,
"for I am lonely! ... Say to this John, the littlest and least
of all the Hazaëls&mdash;that I have done my duty, and ye are
content with me!"
</p>

<p>
The shuddering cry dies on the breeze.  And a terrible voice
answers:
</p>

<p>
"Not the least, but the greatest of all art thou....  For thou
art our leader.  Hear, now!  The choice has fallen to thee.
Worthy art thou to rule us, who canst so well obey! ..."
</p>

<p>
Wonderful sight....  On his left hand, on his right and
before him.  From the skirts of the Mount of Olives, to the
Mohammedan Cemetery, and across the road of the Damascus
Gate, to the site of the Unknown Tombs....  Rank upon rank
of Big Old Men&mdash;stately as Kings, in flowing robes and high
jewelled tiaras, and others in less ancient garb, and others in
more modern garments&mdash;even down to the style of the present
day.  He sees his grandfather, Eli, and his own father, and his
brother Maurice, and stretches his hands to them, crying, as
they smile and wave to him:
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, is this the Sign that I was promised when I was
chained to the bed in the Turkish hut and the Voice spoke to
me? ..."
</p>

<p>
And all the Hazaëls answer in deep, tremendous voices, and
then the turmoil quietens down, and the Biggest of all the Big
Old Men stands forth and gives reply:
</p>

<p>
"We know not of any Sign, O John!  Thou calledst, and
we answered.  Now hear Hazaël Aben Hazaël, who made the
Oath of old....  Lead and we follow....  Command, and
we obey thee.  Speak, and deliver counsels&mdash;thou greatest of
us all!"
</p>

<p>
John hesitates a moment, and then words come to him:
</p>

<p>
"O all ye Big Old Men, listen to me, the littlest!  This is
the lore I have gathered in the thirty-five years of my life.
Human Love is a passing Breath&mdash;a rosy, flying Shadow.
Happiness, Wealth, Honour, Fame&mdash;are cobwebs on the wind.
Rank and Power are gilded stools, worm-eaten and rotten.
Nothing is Real&mdash;nothing is true&mdash;but the Truths ye would not
see!  There is no gain save Sacrifice&mdash;no good save
Renunciation!&mdash;no Way except the Way of the Cross&mdash;no Hope but
in the Blood of CHRIST!  He is our King! ... Now follow
me, and we will do Him homage.  Or cast me out from among
you, and let me be forgotten.  I, John, the littlest of all the
Hazaëls, have said my say! ..."
</p>

<p>
"We hear!"  The deep chorus of answering voices rose and
rolled down on him....  "We hear.  Lead on&mdash;we follow
thee!"
</p>

<p>
"It is well.  Wheel and face southwards, O ye Hazaëls! and
form four men abreast in columns of companies."
</p>

<p>
He gives the order loud and clear, and the extended ranks
of towering figures shift and change, and close in&mdash;and all the
faces are turned from him, except the face of the very Biggest
of all the Big Old Men.  He says to John, in a voice that is
very like John's own:
</p>

<p>
"I am the Captain of thy host.  Give me the route of march."
</p>

<p>
"First to Bethlehem, the Place of His Birth, and then to
His Death Place on Calvary," John answers, though his knees
seem melting under him, and he has hardly any breath.
</p>

<p>
"And then? ... Whither go we? ... For the Gate of the
Place where we abode is now shut behind us....  Is there
not entrance for thee and me and these, by the Gate of
Hope? ... The Gate that opened for Philoremus Fabius&mdash;that I saw
when the Blemmyes gave me death! ..."
</p>

<p>
"But I do not know the Gate of Hope! ..."  John falters,
rather weakly, and the Biggest of all his Big Old Men answers
him sternly now:
</p>

<p>
"The Crucified promised thee a Sign&mdash;and He deceives not.
Ask now His Father in His Name&mdash;to open His Gate of Hope!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And John hears his own voice blundering in the petition:
</p>

<p>
"O Christ, Who art the Very Truth, show now the Sign
Thou promised!  Lead us into the Land of Peace by Thine
Own Gate of Hope!  O look! ... Look, ye Hazaëls!&mdash;in the
sky, over the Holy City! ..."
</p>

<p>
Obedient to the voice and the arm that is uplifted, the faces
of the mighty host, are upturned to the sky.  Faces that are
dark and fierce, noble and mild, harsh and stern or gentle....
Faces of Kings and prophets and sages, leaders of hosts and
seers of visions; men of the sceptre, men of the sword, men
of the crucible, men of the scalpel; men of the pen, men of
the spade and pickaxe&mdash;men of all ages and all climes&mdash;but
Hebrew every one....
</p>

<p>
Over the ancient City that stoned her prophets, and cast out
her Saints, having slain the Son of God&mdash;is another City,
shining-walled, with radiant domes and towers.  Figures more
radiant walk upon her walls and crowd her housetops.  John
knows the City.  Of it he spoke to Esther a little while ago.
</p>

<p>
A Gate is opened in Her walls between two shining towers.
A Man stands on the threshold more glorious than the Sun.
Majesty and meekness radiate from Him, with Love and
Compassion and Mercy....  His Hands are stretched in welcome.
They are Wounded, like His Feet.  He speaks, touching His
naked Side, where the gash of the Roman spear is:
</p>

<p>
"Come unto Me, My people!  Here is the Gate of
Hope! ..."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
An earthly voice John Hazel used to think the loveliest of
women's voices, calls him with eager breathlessness.  Now a
tall figure in a felt hat, with the Red Cross badge and ribbon,
and a flowing cape of red-lined blue, comes swiftly down the
road.  A gallant, womanly creature with beautiful and tender
eyes that John has often dreamed of....  They lighten as
they fall on the great shapeless bulk of the man, who&mdash;dressed
like an Arab&mdash;is sitting in an old bath-chair....
</p>

<p>
The little donkey grazes near, the Arab boy is not visible.
It is just upon the flush of sunset, and the voice of the blind
<i>muezzin</i> at the Mosque of the Throne of Solomon comes
faintly out of the distance, giving the Call to Prayer.  Other
voices take it up and die out in distance; and Katharine would
speak now, but pauses as the Angelus rings its mellow triples
from the Dominican Monastery behind the Tombs of the Kings,
and the Chapel in the garden of the Syrian Patriarch....
</p>

<p>
She ends the little Latin prayer with the Sign of the Cross,
and comes forward.  Clouds of little dun insects like
grasshoppers rise under her footsteps as she comes....  A tiny
bird no bigger than a tit that is perched on the sick man's
shoulder takes wing with a fluttering, silken sound.  And a
creature like a biggish mouse, with kangaroo-like hind legs,
leaps away as Katharine comes to the side of the rickety
bath-chair....
</p>

<p>
She calls the man who sits in it, and he does not answer,
but leans back against his pillow, staring fixedly before him
with his hands upon his knees.  The Arab <i>kuffiyeh</i> partly hides
his face, so changed since she last saw it.  But she catches
the jut of the great hooked nose, and the glitter of the stern
black eyes....
</p>

<p>
A cocksure woman is Katharine, who always thinks she is
wanted.  He does not speak, but she is quite sure he is glad
that she has come....
</p>

<p>
"John Hazel!  Are you vexed with me for thrusting myself
upon you?  I had to come! ... I simply couldn't stay
away! ... You do know why, truest of friends! ... To thank
you&mdash;to bless you!  For Edward and for me, and Julian!"  The
eager words come pouring out as she kneels beside the chair.
"Dearest, best, bravest one&mdash;come back with us to England! ... I
will nurse you,&mdash;you will,&mdash;you shall get well!  There
MUST be happiness and health for you&mdash;it couldn't be
otherwise! ... Say you'll come, or I shall kiss you.  My husband
told me to! ..."
</p>

<p>
She rises to her feet now and leans over him smiling, with
a womanly-tender impulse to hug him to her breast.  Her
warm, sweet arm goes round the man's great neck, her pure
breath fans his forehead.  Her lips touch the scarred
cheek&mdash;and the truth comes home to her.
